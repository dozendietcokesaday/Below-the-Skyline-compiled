Three months of boxing, a jab that sort of works, and wrist pain opening jars.","","It started as cardio. Boxing was a New Year's resolution, a way to quit doomscrolling and maybe drop a few pounds. But something changed. You landed a proper hit on the heavy bag. Your coach raised an eyebrow. You kept going.","","Now you're skipping after-work drinks to train, telling your team lead you have yet another cousin's wedding to attend. She's starting to ask questions.

Its rickety fan provides scant relief in Hong Kong's humid May heat. You fumble with your key before you finally push through the door, and collapse onto your mattress, still in your street clothes.","","Your tiny apartment sits in one of the most densely packed places on Earth. A gritty labyrinth of towering, ageing apartment blocks crammed shoulder-to-shoulder with street markets selling everything imaginable. It's above a 24-hour noodle stall and a 7-Eleven, a far cry from the glamorous Hong Kong of tourist brochures, and high enough that the pungent smell of stinky tofu doesn't reach your cracked-open window.","","Inside: a bed that folds up into the wall when you're not using it, a small clammy desk for the rare work-from-home day, and a pull-up bar in the bathroom doorway. The rent eats up a significant portion of your paycheck, but it's a few minutes' walk to your boxing gym, and to the MTR subway train system that can take you anywhere.","","The adrenaline has faded from your fight an hour ago. The bleachers, the rope ring, the roar of the crowd. Eric's [i]Energy Wave[/i], so unexpected in its power; the exchange of blows, where your boxing skills shone. The moment when you landed your first clean hit in a real match.","*if record_losses = 0","    Your unlikely win against a dangerous competitor, cheered on by the disbelieving crowd.","*elseif record_losses = 1","    Your expected loss against a dangerous competitor.","*else","    *bug Invalid fight record","","*page_break","*gosub_scene calculate_calendar display_date (1)","","Sunlight warms your eyelids. You feel what you ignored yesterday: bruised ribs, sore arms, raw knuckles, a tender jaw. You reflexively check your phone, finding a message from your coach. \"Heard about last night. Come see me when you can.\"","","Thankfully, today is a public holiday, so you visit the gym as soon as you've had some buttered bread and congee downstairs. Coach Lam waves you over, but instead of a scolding, he studies you in silence. Finally, he speaks.","","\"You're doing this, aren't you?\" It's not a question. \"Then we need to get serious. Disciplined training. And I know a bit about the circuit. You'll need to know who you're fighting. I'll give you whatever info I can, but you need to do your own research too.\"","","He hands you a scrap of paper. \"I know the organizers. Got your next fight here.\" You glance at the paper. \"Katie Reynolds. 'Pressure Point.'\"","","You look up to see his mouth configured in a trapezoidal frown. \"They must think highly of you. This one is... different. Might be a trial by fire.\"","","He pauses. \"Be careful. She's not in this for wins or rankings. She's... working something out.\"","","*page_break","After your workout, you head back to your apartment and take a mediocre shower. Clean and refreshed, you search for information about your next opponent. Most underground fighters have at least a few clips circulating, but Katie is oddly absent. On the other hand, there is no shortage of forum comments: \"Scariest fight of my life,\" \"Sheer terror,\" \"She was smiling the whole time.\" You stumble across an older thread where a user speculates about her techniques, writing \"Her assessment reports must be fascinating.\" The next reply simply states, \"We don't discuss that here,\" followed by complete silence, the conversation abruptly ending.","","At last, a low-quality video surfaces on a niche discussion group. It shows a tall brunette woman in colorful workout gear (Jazzercise? Isn't that really dated?) facing a much larger opponent. The fight starts normally until she darts in and presses her fingers against her opponent's arm. The fighter screams in agony and drops to the floor, rolling around and cradling his arm. Katie beams, cheerfully saying something that the audio didn't pick up.","","You snap the laptop shut, but your knee keeps jiggling, heel tapping incessantly on the floorboards. Your fight with Eric involved energy waves and flaming fists, sure. But this feels like something entirely different.","","You tape a fresh workout schedule to the wall. Only four weeks to get ready for Katie \"Pressure Point\" Reynolds, and your marketing job feels trivial, just filler for the weekdays. Your clasp your fingers at the thought of dark basements, abandoned warehouses, harborside arenas\u2014places your coworkers would dismiss as fantasy, but a world you're beginning to step inside.","","*page_break","*gosub_scene calculate_calendar display_date (0)","*gosub_scene utils show_stats","","You contemplate what you've learned about the underground circuit.

Eric's offer to train at Eastside Combat Club is available, and connecting with him would be valuable. In the future, you'll have more options and you'll need to choose carefully who you spend time with, but for now, there's no reason not to take advantage of this opportunity.","","*gosub_scene utils character_visit_choice","*gosub_scene calculate_calendar display_date (15)","*gosub_scene utils show_stats","","With just two weeks until your match with Katie \"Pressure Point\" Reynolds, your continuing search for information has led to more questions than answers. The few additional images you've found show a cheerful woman in colorful clothes, which is jarring when contrasted with her fearsome reputation.

The marketing reports can wait. Tonight is your second fight.","","Your gym bag feels different as you weave through the crowd. No longer a complete novice now, the adrenaline is already starting to fill your body. Tonight's opponent is Katie \"Pressure Point\" Reynolds, a fighter with a dreaded reputation who is still mostly a mystery.","","The fight is in Mong Kok, within walking distance of your apartment. A drab high-rise towers over the narrow street below. It looks abandoned from the outside, with peeling paint and blacked-out windows, as if it were slated for redevelopment and the property companies were waiting for the last holdouts to give in. An inconspicuous woman checks a list at the side entrance facing the alleyway, nodding you through when you give your name.","","*page_break","Inside, the former nightclub has been transformed into a makeshift fighting area.  After adjusting your mouthguard and wrapping your hands, you finish your calisthenics and slip on the red 10oz gloves.","","You spot the bookmaker near the ropes, hunched over a tablet, thumb flicking through unseen columns. He glances up at you for half a second, nods quickly, then looks back down, already updating something.","","As you finish your preparations, you catch fragments of conversation from two fighters nearby. They aren't discussing your upcoming match, but another competitor, apparently a powerful striker. \"... huge potential, yeah,\" one says, \"but the same mistakes every time.\" The other nods. \"It's a pity. They were watching him closely for a while.\" Their voices drop, and they move away.","","Whatever strange techniques Katie uses, you'll deal with them the only way you know: with boxing punches.","","*page_break","*gosub_scene katie_fight fight","*set katie_subplot_available True","*finish"], "labels":{}},

By Friday the air's gone syrupy\u2014thick even before sunrise, clinging through the workday like plastic wrap.

The muscles aren't.","","*page_break","","The following morning, your phone chimes with a message from your coach. \"Next card announced. You vs. Danny Chan. June 30th.\" The name means nothing to you until you search online. Unlike your previous opponents, Danny \"The Dragon\" Chan has a substantial digital footprint: forum posts analyzing his technique, fan websites documenting his fights, and dozens of video clips showing a fighter in a yellow tracksuit who mimics Bruce Lee's signature movements with passionate, if imperfect, execution. Despite his popularity, you can't find footage of him winning a single match.","","The next day at [i]MK[/i], you ask your coach if he knows anything more about Danny Chan. His expression shifts; something like respect?","","\"Danny Chan,\" he says slowly. \"Self-taught Jeet Kune Do. Not the most talented fighter I've seen, but possibly the most dedicated.\" He adjusts your hand position on the speed bag. \"Don't let his record fool you. It might look like an easy win on paper, but no one walks away from a fight with Danny feeling like they've defeated him.\"","","You nod, but something tugs at the edge of your focus.

Too pleasant. Too warm for a gym. She eyes your drills; her painted lips purse in disapproval. \"Seriously, Eric? This is what you're wasting your time on?

A lesson sparked by tension, not yet understood.[/i]","*return","","*label event_3","The red minibus rattles along the winding road, leaving Hong Kong's dense urban sprawl fading in the rear-view mirror. Skyscrapers surrender to low-rise buildings, then to a patchwork of storage depots and half-forgotten villages. Eric stares out at the passing landscape, body hunched. His lips part, then close.","","\"We're almost there,\" he says finally, as the bus turns onto a narrower, bumpier road flanked by overgrown greenery. \"Master Wong doesn't get many visitors these days.\"","","The minibus lurches to a halt on a small, quiet Yuen Long village road. You press two hefty five dollar coins into the driver's leather-gloved hand as you step off. The air feels different\u2014cleaner, cooler against your skin, scented with woodsmoke and damp earth, a stark change from the city's acrid diesel fumes. Old stone houses with faded tile roofs line narrow, paved streets where chickens peck nonchalantly near open doorways, their soft clucking and the occasional flap of wings punctuating the quiet atmosphere. A few elderly villagers chat quietly in shaded spots, their voices a low murmur.","","Eric leads the way without speaking, turning onto a dirt trail that winds upward between dense bamboo groves. Your footsteps crunch on fallen leaves and loose pebbles. The air grows cooler in the shade, carrying the distinctive fragrance of wild lemongrass and camphor.","","After about fifteen minutes of steady hiking, the trail opens into a clearing. There stands a modest Hakka dwelling with blue-grey brick walls and red clay roof tiles, small metal-barred windows, and a squat stone chimney. Surrounding it is a small, neatly tended garden of vegetables and herbs.","","\"This is it,\" Eric says, his voice softer than usual. He pauses for a moment before the weathered wooden door.","","*page_break","The door silently swings open and a short elderly man emerges, dressed in a plain brown shirt and trousers. He moves easily, each step precise yet fluid, his compact frame exuding quiet strength that seems to disturb the air around him. His eyes, sharp and piercing. They settle on you immediately, their gaze cool against your skin.","","\"Eric,\" the old man says, his voice quietly resonant. \"You're late.\"","","\"The minibus driver waited for all the seats to fill before leaving,\" Eric responds, bowing his head slightly in a gesture of respect. \"Master Wong, this is ${first_name} ${last_name}, the training partner I mentioned.\"","","After a silence that stretches for several long seconds, Master Wong nods and turns back toward the house. \"Come inside. The tea is getting cold.\"","","*page_break","The main room is spartan but immaculate. It smells faintly of aged cedarwood, dried chrysanthemum, and oolong tea. Beneath yellowed scrolls of elegant Chinese calligraphy, training staffs lean neatly against one wall. Opposite them, several gleaming, well-maintained blades hang in simple racks, their polished steel surfaces reflecting the amber window light. Your socked feet whisper across hardwood floors burnished to a soft glow.","","Master Wong gestures wordlessly for you both to sit at a low wooden table where three steaming cups of pale green tea are already waiting, their delicate, grassy aroma filling the quiet space.","","\"So this is your new student,\" Master Wong says, his gaze settling on Eric after you are all seated on floor cushions.","","\"Training partner,\" Eric corrects gently. \"We've been working together for about a month now.\"","","Master Wong makes a noncommittal sound as he lifts his cup, his eyes still observing you over the rim. The silence stretches again, punctuated only by the soft sounds of sipping tea. You shift slightly on the cushion, suddenly aware of the dust motes dancing in the shaft of light from the window. Finally, he speaks again, studying you.","","\"Fighting requires sacrifice. What makes this sacrifice worthwhile to you?\"","","*choice","    #\"To find something real beyond my office job.\"","        You explain how the corporate world felt hollow\u2014spreadsheets and meetings that seemed to exist in their own bubble. \"There's an honesty to fighting that I couldn't find elsewhere.

How I respond under pressure. Where my weaknesses are. It's not about winning or losing. It's about finding out who I can become.\"","    #\"I'm still figuring that out, but I know I need this in my life.\"","        \"I'm not sure I have a clear answer yet,\" you admit, meeting Master Wong's eyes. \"The feeling when I land a solid hit, when I adapt mid-fight, when I push through exhaustion... it fills something I didn't know was empty. Boxing started as exercise, but fighting feels like... waking up. I'm still learning why, but I know I can't go back to just existing.\"","","Master Wong listens without interruption, his expression unreadable. When you finish, he nods slowly, remarking, \"At least you do not lie to yourself. That is a beginning.\"","","He turns his attention back to Eric. \"And you? Have you found answers to your questions?\"","","\"I'm working on balancing the traditional training with the energy techniques, like you suggested, Master. Focusing on precision and control rather than just raw power.\"","","\"Hmm.\" Master Wong sets down his tea cup with a soft tap. \"Show me.\"","","Eric rises immediately, moving smoothly to an open area of the floor. He begins a sequence of movements, flowing from one stance to another. Energy gathers as soft, cohesive flows of amber light that trace the path of his limbs.","","Master Wong watches Eric's form and the energy flow. When Eric finishes, returning to a ready stance, the old master remains silent for several seconds.","","\"Better,\" he finally pronounces. \"You no longer fight your own power or try to suppress it. But you still think of it as something separate from yourself, something to be controlled rather than expressed.\"","","Eric's forehead creases. \"I thought control was the goal.\"","","\"Control implies struggle,\" Master Wong replies gently. \"When you struggle against yourself, how can you reach your fullest capability?\" He rises from the table with a fluid grace that belies his age. \"Come. Both of you.\"","","He leads you outside to a small, packed-earth clearing behind the house where three weathered wooden posts stand embedded in the ground in a rough triangle formation. Master Wong positions himself in the center.","","\"Watch,\" he instructs simply.","","*page_break","What follows is unlike any martial arts display you've seen before. Master Wong begins to move. His motions seem deceptively simple\u2014a turn that sends a faint rustle through his cotton garments, a shift of weight that never fully settles, an extended hand with fingers slightly trembling\u2014yet each possesses an undeniable rightness, flowing without apparent effort.","","Energy emanates from him as a subtle, warm glow that seems to extend his presence. The air around him becomes dense, almost syrupy, carrying a faint metallic taste that tingles on your tongue. As he moves, the space between him and the posts seems to compress, waves of heat distorting your vision slightly.","","After less than a minute, Master Wong returns to a neutral stance, the gentle energy dissipating gradually, like ripples fading on calm water.","","\"The energy is not a weapon to be fired,\" he says quietly. \"It is an extension of yourself, as natural as your breath, as inherent as your balance.\"","","Eric's jaw tightens visibly as he takes a short breath. \"I've been trying, Master. But in tournaments... there's pressure to perform, to show power, to meet expectations...\"","","\"Ah, tournaments,\" Master Wong sighs. \"Glory. Spectacle. You learn these skills for what purpose, Eric? To impress crowds? To win trophies?\"","","\"To test myself,\" Eric responds, his chin lifting slightly. \"To measure my progress against others.\"","","\"And how do you measure your progress?\" Master Wong says, his gaze intense. \"Can judges score it?\"","","Silence fills the space between them. Eric holds his master's gaze, the corner of his mouth twitching slightly.","","*fake_choice","    #Observe Eric's reaction.","        You observe the subtle tension in Eric's posture - the slight clench in his jaw, the way his fingers flex then still.","    #Recall Eric's frustration at the gym when Vicky challenged his approach.","        The tension in Eric's face now mirrors what you saw when Vicky questioned his commitment to flash and performance.","    #Focus on your breathing, the way Master Wong taught earlier.","        You center yourself with slow, deliberate breaths, observing without judgment. The conflict before you suddenly seems like another form of training.","","Master Wong turns to you abruptly. \"You. Come here.\"","","You hesitate, then step forward.","","\"Attack Eric,\" he instructs, his voice calm but firm.","","For the next hour, Master Wong guides you both through various exercises, some familiar, some completely new. He has Eric repeat simple blocks and parries, focusing not on force but on attuning to his energy flows.","","Then he turns to you. \"Close your eyes,\" he instructs quietly. \"Feel the air around you. Not with your skin, but deeper. Sense the presence of others.\" Following his quiet instructions, you try to tune into the subtle shifts in the atmosphere.","","*choice","    #Try to sense Master Wong's energy.","        At first, there's nothing but the sound of your own heartbeat in your ears and the soft in-and-out of your breath.

There's nothing but darkness behind your closed eyelids, no hint of hidden power or energy.","","        After many minutes, you feel something. It doesn't register on your skin, but arrives somewhere deeper. A steady but almost imperceptible warmth radiates from where Master Wong stands. It's dense, subdued, just a quiet pressure in the air.","","        \"Mmmmmm,\" you hear Master Wong murmur, as if from a great distance. \"Most cannot sense this kind of restrained energy.\"","","    #Try to sense Eric's energy.","        At first, there's nothing but the sound of your own heartbeat in your ears and the soft in-and-out of your breath.

For several breaths, there's nothing unusual. Then you become aware of something distinct\u2014a pulsing warmth that feels almost electric. Eric's energy surges and recedes like waves breaking on a shore. Bright points of intensity gather around what must be his hands and core.","","        \"Yes,\" Master Wong says softly. \"You sense his vigor, the cadence.\"","","    #Try to sense the threshold between your energy and the surroundings.","        At first, there's nothing but the sound of your own heartbeat in your ears and the soft in-and-out of your breath. Gradually, your other senses heighten\u2014the brush of cloth against your skin, the coolness of the air entering your nostrils, the pressure of the ground beneath your feet.","","        Rather than reaching outward, you turn your awareness inward, trying to locate where \"you\" ends and the rest of the world begins. The distinction seems obvious at first\u2014your skin, your breath. But as you focus, the boundary becomes less clear. Your exhale mingles with the air around you; warmth radiates beyond your fingertips. You sense a subtle field extending inches from your body, pulsing with your heartbeat but also responding to the energies nearby.","","        \"Now you begin to understand,\" Master Wong says, satisfaction evident in his voice. \"This is the foundation of all that we do.\"","","As the afternoon light begins to slant through the bamboo, Master Wong calls an end to the session. Inside again, over a simple meal of fragrant white rice, crisp steamed Chinese kale, and tangy pickled mustard greens, the conversation inevitably shifts back to Eric's upcoming competitions. Wooden chopsticks click gently against the bowls, the sound mingling with the occasional hiss of the dented iron kettle warming on a small burner in the corner.","","\"These commercial events,\" Master Wong says, shaking his head slowly as he picks up a piece of kale with his chopsticks. \"They encourage flash over substance, power over harmony. Spectacle over skill.\"","","\"They also pay the bills, Master,\" Eric counters respectfully. \"And they give me a platform. A chance to demonstrate what real skill can look like.\"","","\"And when will you demonstrate that?\" Master Wong asks, setting down his chopsticks. \"Power with purpose? Responsibility?\"","","Silence falls, broken only by the soft clink of chopsticks. You focus intently on the grains of rice in your own bowl, suddenly feeling like an intruder privy to a long-standing family disagreement.","","Master Wong sighs, a long, slow exhalation, and his stern expression softens almost imperceptibly. \"You have progressed, Eric, that much is clear. Your control is better, your understanding deeper. But technical mastery... technical mastery was never the true challenge for you.\"","","He turns to you unexpectedly, his sharp eyes meeting yours. \"What do you think of my stubborn former student?\"","","*fake_choice","    #Express admiration for Eric's dedication to his craft.","        You tell Master Wong you've been impressed by Eric's commitment, his relentless drive to perfect his techniques, and his willingness to teach others.","    #Acknowledge the conflict you've observed in him.","        You carefully note that Eric seems pulled between competitive ambition and something deeper, still searching for the right path forward.","        *set eric_friendship +1","    #Suggest that Eric respects Master Wong more than he admits.","        You mention that despite their disagreements, Eric speaks of his former master with evident respect and often refers back to his teachings.","        *set eric_friendship +2","","Master Wong listens to your response without blinking, his head tilted slightly, then nods. \"He has always had exceptional talent,\" he murmurs.","","As the simple meal concludes, Master Wong rises and goes to a carved wooden chest in the corner. He returns with a small, tightly tied cloth bag, which he hands to Eric.","","\"The herbs for your training salve,\" he explains. \"Use them sparingly. And I've included something for your friend's wrist.\" He glances briefly at you. \"I noticed he favors it slightly during rotational punches.\"","","Your hand instinctively moves toward your wrist, where neither you nor Eric had noticed anything amiss.","","\"Thank you, Master,\" Eric says, accepting the bag with both hands and bowing respectfully.","","*page_break","As you prepare to leave, Master Wong walks you both to the edge of the clearing. \"Eric.\" Master Wong rests a weathered hand on Eric's shoulder. \"Energy flows where attention goes. The world will always try to direct your attention. What you turn from shapes you as much as what you pursue.\"","","Eric bows deeply again, holding the position for a long moment. \"I understand, Master. And I am grateful for your guidance, even when... even when I struggle with it.\"","","Master Wong turns to you. \"It was interesting to meet you, ${first_name} ${last_name}.

Both you and Eric seem caught up in the afternoon's events. As you wait by the dusty road, Eric finally breaks the silence.","","\"So... that's Master Wong,\" he says, a small, wry smile playing on his lips. \"The man who taught me everything about energy projection... and then spent the next seven years telling me not to use it for competition.\"","","Eric looks out across the darkening fields. \"When I first discovered I could project energy... it was an accident, during a junior tournament.

That he'd been watching for someone like me.\"","","The headlights of the approaching minibus appear in the distance, cutting through the growing dusk.","","\"He taught me to control it, to understand it. But he also had... expectations. About how I would use these skills.\" He sighs. \"I respect his wisdom, his philosophy. I do. But I need to find my own path, not just follow his.\"","","As the minibus rattles to a stop before you, its brakes hissing, Eric gives one last look back toward the trail leading up to his master's hidden home.","","The doors hiss shut, sealing you inside the rattling vehicle. Eric stares out the window as the bus pulls away, his reflection showing a distant expression, the small cloth bag of herbs held loosely, almost forgotten, in his lap.","","[i]Master Wong didn't name it. But you now have a way to practice what he taught\u2014quietly, alone.[/i]","*return","","*label event_4","The vast secondary training hall at the Hong Kong Sports Institute echoes with the sharp snap of Eric's gi and his focused, controlled breathing, sounds magnified in the otherwise silent space. The Pearl River Cup is imminent. Etched onto his face is the evidence of his intense preparation\u2014dark circles smudged beneath his eyes, faint yellowing bruises mottling his forearms. Steadily, the air conditioning hums, carrying a faint scent of floor polish.","","You've been invited to this private after-hours session. The cavernous hall, usually bustling, is empty except for the two of you; the rows of unused equipment like silent witnesses under the bright fluorescent lights.","","\"Alright,\" Eric says, sweat already darkening the back of his gi despite the hall's cool, air-conditioned temperature. He tosses you a pair of reinforced focus mitts that feel dense and surprisingly heavy in your hands. \"I need to work on the transition. Physical to energy, making it seamless.\"","","For the next thirty minutes, you hold the mitts as he works through increasingly complex striking sequences. As the session progresses, a faint amber glow begins to appear around his fists not just at the end of a combination, but subtly, rippling along his arms with each punch and block. The energy no longer erupts suddenly; it seems woven into the movements themselves.","","\"Good,\" Eric says during a brief water break, flexing his fingers as tiny, contained sparks dance between them for a moment. \"The energy needs to flow naturally throughout the sequence, not just explode at the end.\"","","*fake_choice","    #Compliment his progress with the energy integration.","        \"You're getting better at blending your energy with your physical movements,\" you say. \"It looks more natural now, less forced.\"","        ","        Eric nods, a flicker of satisfaction crossing his face. \"That's exactly what I'm working on.

After tracking your movements for a minute, letting his senses attune, he gives you a quick nod. You back away.","","He launches into the technique\u2014a rising uppercut where raw, volatile energy explodes around his striking arm, throwing off waves of palpable heat and filling the air with a sharp, ozone smell. It coalesces into a roaring, dragon-shaped flame that engulfs his entire upper body. Five impossibly fast, consecutive upward punches erupt with reverberating [i]whoosh[/i] sounds as Eric launches high into the air. He lands heavily, his teeth clenched. Instinctively, he shakes his striking arm.","","*page_break","\"Damn it. Still not right,\" he mutters, frustration roughening his voice. \"The energy flow... it's spiking, inconsistent.\"","    ","He sits down briefly, rubbing at his wrist. \"Sometimes I wonder what life would've been like if I'd never figured out the energy thing.\"","","\"When did Master Wong figure out his powers anyway?\" you ask.","","\"He says it happened during a dance break. Back when he was in a boy band. Claims he accidentally zapped a backup dancer.\"","","He takes an easy breath and adjusts the wrist wrap on his right hand.","","For the next hour, Eric repeats the demanding technique relentlessly\u2014dozens of times. Around the twentieth repetition, the veins in his forearms start to stand out. Sweat pours down his face, dripping onto the polished floor with audible [i]taps[/i] in the quiet hall, while his breathing grows ragged, each inhale sounding harsh and strained, punctuated by sharp exhales at the peak of each attempt.

Let's try this one more time.\"","","He launches into it again. This time, as he completes the final strike, the fiery energy doesn't fade cleanly. It clings to his arm like thick, burning honey, pulsing erratically with a low, angry [i]sizzle[/i] and a faint smell of ozone and something vaguely burnt. Eric lands unsteadily.

The device gleams through the wrapping, like an aggressively hostile TV remote control, all angles and protrusions.","","\"So the compression joints adapt to your nerve signals,\" she begins, words tumbling over each other in her excitement. \"The micro-dampeners automatically adjust to how your muscles normally behave, and the torque system filters out random movements so we only measure real responses.\"","","Her hands move animatedly as she continues.

Cadence too exact, tone too careful. This isn't spontaneous; it's a script she's rehearsed.

Like she's adjusting in real time, not just replaying a stored script.","","Three exercises with the wooden rods from last time, each one targeting different nerve groups. Gentle pressure to get the nerves familiar with discomfort without triggering a panic response. Then reinforcement and conditioning. She explains the exercises are based on judo principles. \"Not published. Yet.\" The pride in her voice is unmistakable.","","Each time you complete an exercise set, she scans the sensors and makes small adjustments to how you hold the wooden dowels, her eyes moving between your reactions and the digital readout on her tablet.","","*choice","    #You watch how she tracks the feedback and modifies the pressure points in real time.","        *set trait_analysis +1","        You track her process like it's a system to decode.

You realize she's mirroring your careful attention.","","Katie retrieves what looks like a tuning fork from her duffel bag. It's wrapped in layers of electrical tape, and a small plastic handle has been glued to the base. A copper wire extends from the stem, leading to a battery pack.","","\"This prototype is different from the other tools. It doesn't suppress pain, it modulates it. No one has ever made something like this before.\"","","She flicks a tiny switch. You feel a vibration like standing too close to a subwoofer. It's not sound, but your skin registers the pulse, and your muscles flinch like they're being prepped for impact.","","\"This delivers targeted micro-vibrations at specific frequencies. That can scramble or dampen nerve signals, kind of like jamming a radio channel,\" she continues, gazing with barely contained excitement at the prongs. \"The fork's not electrical. That's what makes it safer. It's closer to a haptic illusion. Like what they use in neural rehab for phantom limb pain, just tuned more aggressively. If the brain gets a corrupted signal from a nerve, it either downplays it or reroutes it.

Nothing reckless. His defenses respond with crisp technique, arms intercepting angles like clockwork\u2014but with no weight behind them. No consequence. You could be shadowboxing.","","It\u2019s like sparring a museum exhibit.","","*set fight_momentum +1","*gosub_scene utils show_fight_momentum","","*choice","    #Exploit his poor timing with aggressive combinations.","        *set fight_momentum +2","        You throw a triple jab-cross-hook series, stepping into each with escalating pressure. Danny reacts too late each time, his guard trailing behind your rhythm. A clean hit lands to his temple, snapping his head to the side. He absorbs it and recovers with grace\u2014but the chant behind him falters slightly. For a moment, the Dragon bleeds.","","    #Observe and study his patterns.","        *set trait_analysis +1","        *set danny_friendship +1","        You stay outside his range, adjusting your footwork, cataloguing each movement. His stance is consistent. His weight shifts are precise. But you start to see it: the rigid sequencing. He\u2019s following choreography, not adapting. There\u2019s discipline here\u2014just no improvisation. No spark.","","    #Fight at his pace. See what he's trying to express.","        *set trait_empathy +1","        *set danny_friendship +2","        You match his rhythm instead of breaking it. Let his slow counters graze the air. You want to see it\u2014what he\u2019s trying to become. He returns each strike with reverent clarity, like he\u2019s honoring something invisible. The moment stretches strangely. The crowd chants. You hesitate. And he stands taller.","","Your gloves feel heavier now\u2014not from fatigue, but from the way they\u2019ve started to matter. You land a clean hook that turns Danny\u2019s head, and for the first time, the crowd\u2019s chant breaks.","","His [i]Intercepting Fist[/i] was timed to meet your entry, but it lags just behind. You feel it as a question mark in the air: form without timing, theory without contact. A ghost of what could\u2019ve been.","","Danny stumbles. He doesn\u2019t reel. He doesn\u2019t collapse. He [i]folds[/i], as if submitting to gravity with dignity, hitting the canvas with barely a thud. You catch a flash of yellow and grey\u2014dust clinging to his tracksuit, sweat dotting the space just beneath his jawline. The chant doesn\u2019t stop. It [i]pauses.[/i] A single breath held in a thousand lungs.","","Then he rises.","","No theatrics. No drama. Just verticality restored, as if he\u2019d never left it. His breathing pattern is unchanged. No gasp, no ragged edge. Just measured intake, calm exhale. It\u2019s not defiance. It\u2019s [i]discipline[/i]. His eyes never waver. No urgency. No doubt. Just focus, perfectly intact, as if nothing had shifted.","","You note the disconnect again\u2014his body responds with precision, but the rhythm is wrong. Still, it\u2019s not deteriorating. It\u2019s static. Like a machine built to repeat rather than react.","","You circle. Shake out your hands. The wraps are damp now\u2014sweat, not nerves. Probably.","","Your gloves feel different. Not heavier exactly. More like... disconnected. There\u2019s a lag. Muscle memory fires on time, but sensation trails behind. The snap of impact is real, but you\u2019re not inside it.","","You land another combination\u2014jab, body shot, cross. Technically clean. Textbook. Danny drops again.","","No groans from the crowd. No gasp. Just the chant faltering, then returning\u2014stronger, more layered, like it's rehearsing something you're not privy to.","","You roll your shoulders. The fatigue isn\u2019t in your muscles. It\u2019s in your [i]intention[/i].","","*gosub_scene utils show_fight_momentum","","*choice","    #Press your advantage. End it quickly.","        *set fight_momentum +2","        *set trait_composure +1","        You cut the distance before he\u2019s fully upright. No hesitation. No performance. Just motion\u2014sharp, efficient, enough to trigger a murmur from the crowd.","","        Another combination lands. A clean body shot folds him again.","","        He rises.","","        The chant builds, steadier now, like a pulse. Not for you. Never for you.","","        You could win this outright. You might already be winning. But every time he stands, the crowd treats it like a miracle.","","        Your gloves feel heavier again.

Step once to the side.","","        Danny adjusts, breathing unchanged. No tension in his frame.","","        You fire a standard jab-cross-hook\u2014mechanical, clean. He blocks the first two, eats the third. His technique folds neatly back into place, like he\u2019s rerunning footage.","","        It feels like a drill now. A bad sparring session with someone who never corrects.","","        But something in the ring holds steady.

No fear, no pleading, not even resolve. Just presence.","","        He\u2019s not dazed. He\u2019s not calculating. He\u2019s... [i]there.[/i]","","        You\u2019ve seen fighters brace, bluff, flinch, stall. But not this. Not whatever [i]this[/i] is.","","        You feel your breath slow involuntarily.","","You circle. Your gloves no longer feel like gear\u2014they feel like declarations. You can still feel the impact of that last clean hit. The vibration traveled up your arm like a tuning fork, and something in the ring shifted.","","Danny had dropped. Briefly. But even in that moment, he looked more like someone finishing a bow than someone falling.","","Now he\u2019s up again, dust clinging to his shoulder like it belongs there. His breathing is still measured. The same intake. The same release.","","The chant doesn\u2019t return all at once. It rebuilds in layers. First a few voices, then more. Soon it\u2019s a wall of sound, not loud exactly\u2014just full. Like resonance filling an empty bowl.","","You check his eyes again. Still clear. Still watching. Still... present.","","Another exchange comes. Your punch lands. Not a knockout, not even a stinger\u2014but hard enough to make the crowd gasp as one. A breath, drawn in and never released.","","He steps back, steady. The crowd leans forward.","","A beat later, they begin to chant again. \u201cDragon... Dragon...\u201d","","They\u2019re not responding to damage. They\u2019re responding to something else.","","You don\u2019t feel the usual shift\u2014the tempo change when a fight tilts. There\u2019s no tilt here. No collapse. Just repetition. Just return.","","The next minute is loose around the edges. You throw punches. Danny throws back. Neither of you speaks, but the crowd narrates for you. Their volume dips and crests with every motion. And somehow, it doesn\u2019t feel like noise.","","When Danny rises again\u2014again\u2014the crowd doesn't cheer. They [i]synchronize[/i]. A thousand bodies adjusting forward by an inch, like they\u2019re tethered to the same pulse.","","And then, nearing the bell, the volume drops.","","Not fatigue. Not boredom.","","Silence, pulled tight.","","Danny is still standing.","","You are still standing.","","The bell hasn\u2019t rung yet. But it's close. And something in the room asks: Why are you here?","","Why are you fighting?","","*gosub_scene utils show_fight_momentum","","*choice","    #Fight for the win. This is still a competition.","        *set fight_momentum +1","        *set trait_analysis +1","        You press forward, gloves moving on instinct. Each punch is delivered with clean, functional force. No room for symbolism. Just angles, balance, execution.","","        Danny responds as he always has\u2014by receiving. He absorbs the pressure, staggers, recovers, corrects his stance like it's habit.","","        The chant doesn\u2019t break. It folds around your momentum like cloth. You feel the round tilting toward you\u2014points scored, openings found\u2014but it lands with less weight than expected.","","        The bell rings. You won this. On paper.","","        But the air says otherwise.","    #Let the final minute ride out with clean technique.","        *set trait_composure +1","        *set danny_friendship +1","        You reset your stance.

So does he.","    #Try to knock him down one last time.","        *set fight_momentum +2","        You surge forward\u2014no feints, no caution. Just a clean entry and a hard, final strike.","","        It lands. Danny drops again. His hands touch canvas. For a second, it looks like he might stay down.","","        Then he rises. Again. Of course he does.","","        He adjusts the yellow wristband between his breaths. Not checking for damage. Not tending to pain. Just realigning a symbol.","","        The crowd erupts, not in triumph, not in shock, but in rhythm.","","        Like a ritual completed.","","        You step back, breathing hard. He\u2019s already back in stance.","","        You could do this forever. He would let you.","","The bell rings.","","You\u2019re not sure what you expected. Applause? Relief? Resolution?","","What arrives instead is silence\u2014dense and gravitational. The kind that demands stillness. The kind that recognizes a threshold has been crossed, even if it\u2019s unclear which direction you\u2019ve gone.","","The referee raises your hand.","","There\u2019s no mistaking it. You won. On scorecards or spectacle or simply because you\u2019re still upright. But beside you, Danny doesn\u2019t flinch. Doesn\u2019t bow his head. Doesn\u2019t even look your way. He just stands\u2014shoulders square, eyes ahead, posture steady as a column.","","You remember the applause when you entered. Polite. Measured. But this... this is different. The sound that rises now is not for you. It\u2019s for something older. Something chosen.","","Then a sound begins. Not a cheer. Not a chant.","","The sound of [i]movement[/i]. Thousands of people rising to their feet\u2014not in celebration, but in synchronized acknowledgment. As if the act of standing itself is the tribute.","","It doesn\u2019t matter that he lost. That he always loses. The crowd knows what he gave. They were here to witness. And that was enough.","","*if (danny_friendship <= 2)","    Danny doesn\u2019t acknowledge you. Not out of spite\u2014he\u2019s simply oriented elsewhere. His ritual isn\u2019t for you. He returns to the crowd that understands him, the chant already beginning to rebuild as he walks. You fought him. But you weren\u2019t part of what he\u2019s building.","*elseif (danny_friendship <= 4)","    As the noise rises, Danny turns slightly. Not a full glance. Just enough to register that you\u2019re still there. Still watching. His bow includes you this time\u2014not personal, but precise. You weren\u2019t his opponent. You were his mirror.","","    He turns again, facing the crowd. One hand to his heart, he bows to each side in turn. It\u2019s not performative. It\u2019s ritual.","*else","    Before he steps away, Danny stops. Raises one hand\u2014not to the crowd, but to you. His fingers touch the yellow band, then press briefly against his heart before extending in your direction. Not a salute. Not a bow. A gesture of calm acceptance. It lands.","","*page_break","You glance toward the edge of the ring. A woman in a dark coat flips through a tiny notebook with brisk fingers. She\u2019s not watching the crowd, not watching you\u2014only Danny. Page after page turns, each filled with quick, slanted notes. Observation, not emotion.","","You look down. Your gloves are still on. Your arms still tense. Your breathing is shallow. The fight is over. But something hasn\u2019t left you yet.","","Danny exhales softly. Bows once\u2014low and formal. Then rises. As he exits the ring, supporters reach out, not with high-fives or camera flashes, but with open hands. Hands brush lightly against his shoulders\u2014not to celebrate, but to connect. As if he\u2019s a vessel, carrying something precious from the ring back into the world. Like he carries it for all of them.","","*return",""], "labels":{"fight":0}}}</script><script>

/* The function needs some explaining.
We want the game to be "refreshable," e.g. on the web.
So we only make a "real" autosave as you click "Next"
But if we do it that way, when we visit the stat screen, it's out of date
So we make a "temp" autosave slot, right as the page finishes redrawing,
and the stat screen uses the "temp" autosave to display your current data.
When you refresh the page, the "temp" autosave is rewritten.

If you save stats on the stat screen, they're written into tempStatWrites;
when the stat screen saves, we transfer tempStatWrites back to the main
game (if the main game is running in a separate iframe, e.g. iOS).

If the main game is about to write the main "" slot, we merge the temp
stat writes into the main stats (and clear the stat writes) before
saving.

Thus, stat changes on the stat screen will only be permanently saved when
the player clicks "Next" in the main game, ensuring that the game is still
refreshable.
