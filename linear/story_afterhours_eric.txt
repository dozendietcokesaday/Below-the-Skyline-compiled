Dead air, empty gyms, emptier streets. Even the undercover policemen avert their eyes.

Hungry Ghost month. People walk with their shoulders drawn in, weaving around the incense, oranges splattered with wax, suckling pig heads. A double-decker brakes hard, metal squealing against metal, an Alphard barging into its lane. You flinch before you realise.

The city itself smells different. Burnt offerings in the air, a faint sourness in the smog. A bubble tea shop with a few dozen drinks on the countertop, plastic seals sagging, pearls bloated, no one to claim them. Red marker on a yellow post-it note that's stamped onto a glass shopfront, fluttering under the sodium streetlight. You want to move through all this, to feel what it's like.

In the distance, a basketball thuds onto concrete, each bounce dull and heavy. It might be easier if you had someone with you, against all this.

You ask Eric if he's free for a walk tomorrow night. Eric's text comes back promptly. "A walk? Tomorrow? I have training..."

You answer with an acknowledgement of how important training is to him. Then another message arrives. "I almost never skip training. But I will, for you. Just this once."

Saturday, 31 August 2024

The lighting at the MTR entrance is out, the shadows pooling in the stairwell. You take the bus instead. You stay on the lower deck, leaning onto a steel pole as cold blasts of air drag the sweat from your shirt, and a few minutes later you step out at Ferry Street into the choking evening air.

You round the corner, circling some metal fencing, to Kansu Street outside the Jade Hawker Bazaar. Its tiny entrance is lacquered in red and gold, black lettering announcing greetings in half a dozen languages: Bem-vindo, Swaagat, Benvenuti. It's shut for the night.
 
Eric's waiting there at the entrance, hair combed back more neatly than usual. His gi is nowhere to be seen today, replaced by a red polo shirt that's tucked into black jeans, leather belt a notch too loose. His leather shoes gleam, too shiny for his casual attire. He looks straight at you, a wide grin forming before he reins it back, and embraces you in a tight, warm hug.

"Claire! Looking forward to this."

Together, you set off towards the main road. You pass a half-built highway flyover, its plastic barricades spilled onto the pavement, almost melting in the heat. A vacant retail store, its metal shutters plastered with Midland and Centaline [i]For Rent[/i] signs, each new layer pasted over the others. A herbal tea and turtle jelly shop, one of the old ones, with the giant metal urn, not the bright red plastic chain stores where they put too much honey in. The bitter smell of medicinal roots drifts out.

Eric observes, "It's interesting that they serve turtle jelly like a dessert here. Back in Shunde it was more like a medicine thing." He looks over at you, eyes gauging your interest.

"What's Shunde like?"

"Shunde? We have way better dessert, that's for sure. I've lived in Hong Kong for years but I still go back for the food."

You ask him what he thinks of his hometown, whether he likes it here in Hong Kong.

"Hong Kong has a lot more restaurants. But in Shunde they cook with more care. They make the dace stuffing for the peppers by hand, pounding it for hours." He slows, then stops walking, looking down at the pavement.

"My mum made the best stuffed peppers. I kept hogging them, so one time she left the seeds in one of the peppers. I took a huge bite and my throat was on fire. I thought I would literally die, and she's laughing, patting me on the shoulder. I was seven then."

You try not to laugh, picturing a young Eric gasping for air. He nods and starts walking again, a brief smile bubbling to the surface. 

---

A few minutes later, you arrive at a major intersection, where the foot traffic thickens. As you're waiting at the pedestrian light, a passing red double-decker blasts you with exhaust, the fumes mixing with the smell of heated metal. A half-burnt hell banknote flutters across your path, the short edge crisped into black ash as it brushes across your shin.

The Gascoigne Road flyover looms above the traffic, its concrete pillars pressing down on the street below. A truck roars by overhead, rusted steel rods clanking as they grind against themselves. You turn right onto Nathan Road, grimy vehicles inching forwards on all six lanes. A van darts forward; a horn screeches as the bus slams on the brakes. The stop-start traffic hits you in waves, testing your balance.

Walking along, you see the Eaton HK hotel across the street, its big billboard showing a series of arthouse Pride snapshots. No one spares it a glance. Then behind it, a love hotel, a discreet crescent moon logo above the entrance. You pass a roadside newsstand, with triad pulp comics, soft-core magazines sealed in black plastic, horse racing tip sheets. Hard to imagine it will last the year.

Eric notices the love hotel and flashes you a half-smile. "I like it. Clean, simple. A room with a purpose. There's no private space in this city."

"Yeah. An entire family sharing a hundred square feet. People don't have a choice."

He waves a hand at an old apartment block, dozens of storeys high. "That's just life here. We get used to anything."

He rubs his chin with one hand as he stares up at the apartment block. Then a smile, like he's happy with the thought.

"Some people look down on it, but it's giving people a door they can close."

You continue along Nathan Road, a rapid-fire chime accompanying the green pedestrian light. A smell like damp cardboard wafts out of a cul-de-sac, as large warm droplets plop on the pavement, splashing onto your shoes, steady drips from air-conditioning units high above. You look up at the [i]tong lau[/i] with their protruding balconies, and sidestep the worst of the splatter zone.

Past another pedestrian crossing, you stroll past a plaster wall, empty but for the ghost of a pawn shop sign, the scar left behind where the lettering was removed. Just above head height, reflexology and foot massage billboards in simplified Chinese. On the street, sandwich boards in faded, coated plastic. Through a break in the phalanx of buildings above, you glimpse a bare metal frame, several storeys high, where the neon signs used to hang.

Ahead, clothes shops and property agencies and a burger joint. A vacant shopfront with an overflowing jumble of [i]For Rent[/i] signs, Centaline and Midland and more you don't recognise, enthusiastically pasted over each other, contoured like a three-dimensional map. You take a deep breath, the fresh air steadying you. A man approaches, hawking loudly, then sees you and redirects his spit to the gutter. 

A bright orange cylindrical rubbish bin stands near the railing, the shallow metal bowl on top full of cigarette butts, some still glowing amber. Black-and-white road signs announce Ning Po Street, Nanking Street. A sign advertises karaoke, backlit by an array of white fluorescents, the right half gone dark. Pink and blue neons beckon you into a "health centre", the blinking arrow pointing up a dark narrow staircase like bait. From a mahjong parlour comes the sharp crack of a tile slammed on wood.

An old woman blocks most of the sidewalk, an iron rod in her hand. She's stoking the flames in a metal barrel alongside offerings of poached chicken and barbecued pork in oily styrofoam boxes. The makeshift furnace blazes, spitting out ash and embers and choking black smoke that overpowers the minibus exhaust at the kerbside.

Eric nods his head towards the furnace. "Can you see that? It's an entire mansion, with windows and cars and all, made out of paper. Burnt in a minute."

He lowers his eyes, a faint frown on his face, something that could be sorrow. It looks like he wants to say more, but he swallows his words and stares at the old woman and the flames.

You confess that you've seen these furnaces around this time of year, but you've never thought about what they represent.

Eric brightens, turning his head to face you. "Yeah, it's an interesting story. Around this time the barrier between earth and hell weakens. So the hungry ghosts can come and visit. They call it hungry, but I think it's more like, restless, or something like that."

He clears his throat. "Anyway, that's why people don't fight. But it also means you can give them things more easily. So this woman is sending gifts to someone she knew."

He gazes at the furnace for a bit more. Then, satisfied, he turns towards the narrow gap between the concrete wall and the woman. You squeeze past, Eric guiding you forward with a steady hand on your back.

You're a block away from Jordan MTR now. The traffic is louder, but there's also the chatter of overlapping Cantonese and Mandarin conversations, music blaring from phone accessory shops. You pass a metal cart, a plastic cut-out window showing the [i]tong cung beng[/i] inside, honeycomb-like sugar cylinders dusted with coconut flakes and wrapped in a thin pancake. The vendor lifts the lid and chips at the honeycomb with a metal spatula. [i]Tink, tink, tink[/i]. A warm, nutty smell hits you. Don't see those much any more.

Overtaking you, a pair of shoppers wheeling Rimowas, the man sweating in chinos, dress shirt and blazer, the woman in a pink Juicy Couture tracksuit, oversized sunglasses to shield her from the dim light. She plants a quick, quiet peck on his cheek. He leans in, still looking forward, and they continue walking. The clothes suggest they're mainland tourists. Not many of those still come.

You can't tell if it was habit or intimacy. Either way, it was something fragile.

As you wait at the pedestrian light, you're bombarded by a cacophony of honking. A plug of taxis has blocked the intersection, and a truck driver is stabbing his finger at them and mouthing a stream of obscenities behind his rolled-up window. More cars and more taxis join in the honking, a medley of long, continuous screeches and rapid jabs of noise.

The light turns green, and you cross and approach the mouth of the MTR station. A pair of policemen straddle the entrance, clad in light blue shirts and dark blue cargo trousers. They scan the foot traffic, eyes sharp, hunting for anyone wearing the wrong clothes. No one looks up.

Eric casts a glance at the policemen, scanning their posture more than their faces. "Discipline isn't holding your breath. Their energy is stagnant."

"Maybe they don't even care about energy. They're just doing what the uniform demands."

Eric doesn't reply, preferring to move past as soon as possible.

You pass a jewellery shop, its lone signpost still standing where the street used to shine. Your eyes sweep across the display window. Diamond specks framed in gold and platinum. A necklace, showcasing a fat pig in solid gold, with half a dozen dangling gold piglets. The pig's smiling.

A man in a grey T-shirt and shorts walks past you, pausing regularly to drill a Muay Thai block, knee rising, elbow dropping. You catch Eric squinting at him, his mouth opening slightly then closing. The crowd thickens at Austin Road, so you slip back onto Tak Shing Street, where the sidewalk breathes again. A 7-Eleven's there, next to an overly orange Mannings pharmacy. Two teens shuffle out, each holding malt Vitasoys and an opened bag of [i]Ethnicans[/i] potato chips, the smell of onion and garlic trailing behind them.

You nod at Eric and duck inside the 7-Eleven, the electronic door chime sharp and grating. You squeeze sideways between stacked shelves. You head for the hot food counter and order some takeaway [i]siu mai[/i]. He ladles a dozen of them into a flimsy plastic tray, pasty yellow skin wrapped around a lump of grey fish paste. He tosses a handful of thin bamboo skewers on top and hands it to you.

---

Carrying the food in one hand, you walk down Tak Shing street. It's just off the main road, but a few steps in and it's quiet. An unmanned currency booth on your left, the frozen exchange rates ghosted into the display. A Japanese restaurant, styrofoam box of dead mackerel left at the entrance. Property agencies, signs shouting HUGE DISCOUNT, EMIGRATION SALE. The prices are still seven figures.

At the end, a playground. Crumb rubber flooring, a slide barely a metre high, a swing with rust on the chains. No children. Around it, clusters of metal chairs, the steel a cold shock even in the summer heat. A few elderly residents are seated, reading newspapers, waving small hand fans, listening to stock tips on the radio.

You rest your arm on the armrest, then lift it away from the film of dried syrup. Eric's still.

"They built this place for movement. But no one moves."

"The stillness doesn't bother me. I'm here, beside you."

His eyes close as he breaks into a smile, though he catches himself almost immediately.

"Thank you, Claire. That's enough for me."

You've seen him blaze in the ring. This is something else entirely.

At a far row of seats, an old woman stands, mumbles something to her friends, then drifts away. Eric leans back slightly, spine still straight, and skewers a [i]siu mai[/i], lifting it to you. As you take it from him, there's barely any space between your hands.

You take the skewer naturally, brushing your hand across his. He smiles, and there's the faintest flush across his cheeks. You eat the [i]siu mai[/i], not even noticing the rubbery taste, and then let your hand settle on the armrest between you.

Eric places his hand on yours. The warmth is steady, contained. He keeps his gaze straight forward, but the silence feels shared.

The swing creaks once in the breeze, then goes still.
