Dead air, empty gyms, emptier streets. Even the undercover policemen avert their eyes.

Hungry Ghost month. People walk with their shoulders drawn in, weaving around the incense, oranges splattered with wax, suckling pig heads. A double-decker brakes hard, metal squealing against metal, an Alphard barging into its lane. You flinch before you realise.

The city itself smells different. Burnt offerings in the air, a faint sourness in the smog. A bubble tea shop with a few dozen drinks on the countertop, plastic seals sagging, pearls bloated, no one to claim them. Red marker on a yellow post-it note that's stamped onto a glass shopfront, fluttering under the sodium streetlight. You want to move through all this, to feel what it's like.

In the distance, a basketball thuds onto concrete, each bounce dull and heavy. It might be easier if you had someone with you, against all this.

You ask Chloe if she's free for a walk tomorrow night.

"You can't be serious. A walk? On the pavement?"

You confirm that this is your intention.

"God, that's insane. Fine, let's do it. Can't wait to see what I'm missing."

Saturday, 31 August 2024

The lighting at the MTR entrance is out, the shadows pooling in the stairwell. You take the bus instead. You stay on the lower deck, leaning onto a steel pole as cold blasts of air drag the sweat from your shirt, and a few minutes later you step out at Ferry Street into the choking evening air.

You round the corner, circling some metal fencing, to Kansu Street outside the Jade Hawker Bazaar. Its tiny entrance is lacquered in red and gold, black lettering announcing greetings in half a dozen languages: Bem-vindo, Swaagat, Benvenuti. It's shut for the night.
 
Chloe's already there, leaning against the wall. Her black cropped top hangs loose above black drawstring pants and scuffed white sneakers. Her eyes are sharp in the streetlights, lines too clean. A small silver stud sparkles in the light as she turns her head, then it's gone.

"Steve, this better not be boring," she says, walking alongside you. A hint of peach drifts from her direction.

Together, you set off towards the main road. You pass a half-built highway flyover, its plastic barricades spilled onto the pavement, almost melting in the heat. A vacant retail store, its metal shutters plastered with Midland and Centaline [i]For Rent[/i] signs, each new layer pasted over the others. A herbal tea and turtle jelly shop, one of the old ones, with the giant metal urn, not the bright red plastic chain stores where they put too much honey in. The bitter smell of medicinal roots drifts out.

Chloe boots a stray rock aside. "You're serious, aren't you? We're just going to walk like this." She smirks, one eyebrow arched, as she continues alongside you.

You say that your biggest joy in life is walking on pavement and achieving nothing. Chloe stops walking, rooted in place, and looks at you, eyes wide open, mouth hanging open. She stares for another second. Then a smile dances across her lips.

"The scary thing is, you could have been serious."

She runs a hand through her hair. "This walking... it's... not bad, actually."

She grimaces, then bumps your shoulder with hers, unbalancing you for a moment. She flashes you a cheeky grin, and lightly pulls you along by the elbow.

---

A few minutes later, you arrive at a major intersection, where the foot traffic thickens. As you're waiting at the pedestrian light, a passing red double-decker blasts you with exhaust, the fumes mixing with the smell of heated metal. A half-burnt hell banknote flutters across your path, the short edge crisped into black ash as it brushes across your shin.

The Gascoigne Road flyover looms above the traffic, its concrete pillars pressing down on the street below. A truck roars by overhead, rusted steel rods clanking as they grind against themselves. You turn right onto Nathan Road, grimy vehicles inching forwards on all six lanes. A van darts forward; a horn screeches as the bus slams on the brakes. Engines rumble, but the pavement is half-empty, like the city's pulse is missing.

Walking along, you see the Eaton HK hotel across the street, its big billboard showing a series of arthouse Pride snapshots. No one spares it a glance. Then behind it, a love hotel, a discreet crescent moon logo above the entrance. You pass a roadside newsstand, with triad pulp comics, soft-core magazines sealed in black plastic, horse racing tip sheets. Hard to imagine it will last the year.

Chloe points at the moon logo. "I'd take the moon hotel over the fancy one any day. Eaton forces you to pretend to be romantic."

You say that you'd take the moon hotel too. Being direct has its advantages. Her eyes gleam, sharp as glass. "Direct, huh? Dangerous. I like it."

Chloe moves in, close enough that you feel the warmth from her arm. "Makes me wonder if you'd actually follow through." She holds eye contact with you, just inches away.

You realise you've been taking shallow breaths, and draw in a deep one. She moves back a step. "Anyway. Moon hotel. No contest."

She slides her hands into her pockets and keeps walking.

---

You continue along Nathan Road, a rapid-fire chime accompanying the green pedestrian light. A smell like damp cardboard wafts out of a cul-de-sac, as large warm droplets plop on the pavement, splashing onto your shoes, steady drips from air-conditioning units high above. You look up at the [i]tong lau[/i] with their protruding balconies, and sidestep the worst of the splatter zone.

Past another pedestrian crossing, you stroll past a plaster wall, empty but for the ghost of a pawn shop sign, the scar left behind where the lettering was removed. Just above head height, reflexology and foot massage billboards in simplified Chinese. On the street, sandwich boards in faded, coated plastic. Through a break in the phalanx of buildings above, you glimpse a bare metal frame, several storeys high, where the neon signs used to hang.

Ahead, clothes shops and property agencies and a burger joint. A vacant shopfront with an overflowing jumble of [i]For Rent[/i] signs, Centaline and Midland and more you don't recognise, enthusiastically pasted over each other, contoured like a three-dimensional map. You take a deep breath, the fresh air steadying you. A man approaches, hawking loudly, then sees you and redirects his spit to the gutter. 

A bright orange cylindrical rubbish bin stands near the railing, the shallow metal bowl on top full of cigarette butts, some still glowing amber. Black-and-white road signs announce Ning Po Street, Nanking Street. A sign advertises karaoke, backlit by an array of white fluorescents, the right half gone dark. Pink and blue neons beckon you into a "health centre", the blinking arrow pointing up a dark narrow staircase like bait. From a mahjong parlour comes the sharp crack of a tile slammed on wood.

An old woman blocks most of the sidewalk, an iron rod in her hand. She's stoking the flames in a metal barrel alongside offerings of poached chicken and barbecued pork in oily styrofoam boxes. The makeshift furnace blazes, spitting out ash and embers and choking black smoke that overpowers the minibus exhaust at the kerbside.

Chloe grins suddenly, the twitching kind you've seen before. You take a deep breath.

"Imagine being stuck in hell and a big bowl of paper noodles pops up on your table. What would you do?"

"That would be interesting. Imagine biting down on that!"

Chloe bursts into laughter. "Yes! Everyone watching you out of the corner of their eyes, and you have to pretend to enjoy choking it down!"

She steps in close, slurping some invisible noodles right in front of your face, then clutching her throat with her hand, before pulling back. A few passers-by glance over at her.

Still grinning, she points at the gap between the concrete wall and the woman. You squeeze past; Chloe's hands land on your shoulders, steering you forward.

You're a block away from Jordan MTR now. The traffic is louder, but there's also the chatter of overlapping Cantonese and Mandarin conversations, music blaring from phone accessory shops. You pass a metal cart, a plastic cut-out window showing the [i]tong cung beng[/i] inside, honeycomb-like sugar cylinders dusted with coconut flakes and wrapped in a thin pancake. The vendor lifts the lid and chips at the honeycomb with a metal spatula. [i]Tink, tink, tink[/i]. A warm, nutty smell hits you. Don't see those much any more.

Overtaking you, a pair of shoppers wheeling Rimowas, the man sweating in chinos, dress shirt and blazer, the woman in a pink Juicy Couture tracksuit, oversized sunglasses to shield her from the dim light. She plants a quick, quiet peck on his cheek. He leans in, still looking forward, and they continue walking. The clothes suggest they're mainland tourists. Not many of those still come.

You can't tell if it was habit or intimacy. Either way, it was something fragile.

As you wait at the pedestrian light, you're bombarded by a cacophony of honking. A plug of taxis has blocked the intersection, and a truck driver is stabbing his finger at them and mouthing a stream of obscenities behind his rolled-up window. More cars and more taxis join in the honking, a medley of long, continuous screeches and rapid jabs of noise.

The light turns green, and you cross and approach the mouth of the MTR station. A pair of policemen straddle the entrance, clad in light blue shirts and dark blue cargo trousers. They scan the foot traffic, eyes sharp, hunting for anyone wearing the wrong clothes. No one looks up.

Chloe ignores the policemen, but after you pass, she remarks, "Money gets you everything in this city. Except immunity from those brutes."

"All the money in the world won't protect you from raw power."

Chloe smirks, but her eyes are hard for a moment. "Anyway. Come on."

You pass a jewellery shop, its lone signpost still standing where the street used to shine. Your eyes sweep across the display window. Diamond specks framed in gold and platinum. A necklace, showcasing a fat pig in solid gold, with half a dozen dangling gold piglets. The pig's smiling.

A man in a grey T-shirt and shorts walks past you, pausing regularly to drill a Muay Thai block, knee rising, elbow dropping. You catch Chloe's face twisting, her lips curled, eyebrows drawn together. The crowd thickens at Austin Road, so you slip back onto Tak Shing Street, where the sidewalk breathes again. A 7-Eleven's there, next to an overly orange Mannings pharmacy. Two teens shuffle out, each holding malt Vitasoys and an opened bag of [i]Ethnicans[/i] potato chips, the smell of onion and garlic trailing behind them.

You nod at Chloe and duck inside the 7-Eleven, the electronic door chime sharp and grating. You squeeze sideways between stacked shelves. You head for the hot food counter and order some takeaway [i]siu mai[/i]. He ladles a dozen of them into a flimsy plastic tray, pasty yellow skin wrapped around a lump of grey fish paste. He tosses a handful of thin bamboo skewers on top and hands it to you.

---

Carrying the food in one hand, you walk down Tak Shing street. It's just off the main road, but a few steps in and it's quiet. An unmanned currency booth on your left, the frozen exchange rates ghosted into the display. A Japanese restaurant, styrofoam box of dead mackerel left at the entrance. Property agencies, signs shouting HUGE DISCOUNT, EMIGRATION SALE. The prices are still seven figures.

At the end, a playground. Crumb rubber flooring, a slide barely a metre high, a swing with rust on the chains. No children. Around it, clusters of metal chairs, the steel a cold shock even in the summer heat. A few elderly residents are seated, reading newspapers, waving small hand fans, listening to stock tips on the radio.

You rest your arm on the armrest, then lift it away from the film of dried syrup. You shift slightly on the metal seat. Chloe sprawls back in her chair, legs spread wide. She grabs a [i]siu mai[/i] from your tray with her fingers and pops it into her mouth. She grimaces at you, then swallows.

"A playground with no kids. Such a romantic date. You're really spoiling me."

"Gourmet siu mai, scenic playground view. What more could anyone ask for?"

Chloe laughs, shaking her head. Her eyes flicker over your face, reading it.

"If this is your idea of a date, I'm both impressed and concerned."

You study the [i]siu mai[/i] tray with interest, instead of answering.

Chloe becomes still for a moment, then picks up another [i]siu mai[/i] with her fingers, brings it halfway to her mouth, and pauses. She raises her eyebrows, a slow smile spreading on her face, and she offers it to you.

You lean forward and open your mouth.

She leaves you hanging for a moment, then slides the [i]siu mai[/i] in. As she pulls away, she slowly brushes your lower lip with her fingers.

Chloe just watches you, her fingers resting on her lips. You chew slowly, not even tasting it, stretching out each second.

She doesn't look away, nor can you read her expression. 

A radio crackles with a weather report. Rain tomorrow.
