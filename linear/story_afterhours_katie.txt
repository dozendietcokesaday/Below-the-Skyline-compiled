Dead air, empty gyms, emptier streets. Even the undercover policemen avert their eyes.

Hungry Ghost month. People walk with their shoulders drawn in, weaving around the incense, oranges splattered with wax, suckling pig heads. A double-decker brakes hard, metal squealing against metal, an Alphard barging into its lane. You flinch before you realise.

The city itself smells different. Burnt offerings in the air, a faint sourness in the smog. A bubble tea shop with a few dozen drinks on the countertop, plastic seals sagging, pearls bloated, no one to claim them. Red marker on a yellow post-it note that's stamped onto a glass shopfront, fluttering under the sodium streetlight. You want to move through all this, to feel what it's like.

In the distance, a basketball thuds onto concrete, each bounce dull and heavy. It might be easier if you had someone with you, against all this.

You ask Katie if she's free for a walk tomorrow night. Her response arrives almost instantly, a real-time cascade of messages.

"Really? You asked me?" A short pause, the [i]Katie is typing...[/i] notification pulsing.

"Yes! Absolutely! I'd love to! Oh. Sorry for rambling, I wasn't expecting this. See you tomorrow!"

Saturday, 31 August 2024

The lighting at the MTR entrance is out, the shadows pooling in the stairwell. You take the bus instead. You stay on the lower deck, leaning onto a steel pole as cold blasts of air drag the sweat from your shirt, and a few minutes later you step out at Ferry Street into the choking evening air.

You round the corner, circling some metal fencing, to Kansu Street outside the Jade Hawker Bazaar. Its tiny entrance is lacquered in red and gold, black lettering announcing greetings in half a dozen languages: Bem-vindo, Swaagat, Benvenuti. It's shut for the night.
 
Katie's standing at the entrance, sporting a plain pastel top tucked into black jeans, a slim belt, and spotless white sneakers, laces tied into neat bunny ears. She smooths her shirt, then gives you a warm smile, eyes crinkling, and embraces you in a slightly awkward hug, her body not quite touching you.

"Steve! I wasn't sure if this was casual or, like... never mind. I'm happy you asked!"

Together, you set off towards the main road. You pass a half-built highway flyover, its plastic barricades spilled onto the pavement, almost melting in the heat. A vacant retail store, its metal shutters plastered with Midland and Centaline [i]For Rent[/i] signs, each new layer pasted over the others. A herbal tea and turtle jelly shop, one of the old ones, with the giant metal urn, not the bright red plastic chain stores where they put too much honey in. The bitter smell of medicinal roots drifts out.

"Do you like turtle jelly Steve? I tried both kinds, I actually liked the bitter one more. Made me shiver and almost seize up, you know? So fun! Uh. It's fine to like that, right?" She glances at you, bites her lower lip.

"I don't think many people enjoy eating it," you say. "But you turned it into an adventure. That's pretty cool."

Katie breaks into a broad smile. "Wow... thanks, Steve. I... no one says this kind of thing to me, usually..."

She blurts out, "do you want to... eat some?" You're already past the shop. You open your mouth, and a soft "uhh" escapes. A faint blush appears on her cheeks as she looks straight ahead. Her hand twitches at her side, close to yours.

A few minutes later, you arrive at a major intersection, where the foot traffic thickens. As you're waiting at the pedestrian light, a passing red double-decker blasts you with exhaust, the fumes mixing with the smell of heated metal. A half-burnt hell banknote flutters across your path, the short edge crisped into black ash as it brushes across your shin.

The Gascoigne Road flyover looms above the traffic, its concrete pillars pressing down on the street below. A truck roars by overhead, rusted steel rods clanking as they grind against themselves. You turn right onto Nathan Road, grimy vehicles inching forwards on all six lanes. A van darts forward; a horn screeches as the bus slams on the brakes. Engines rumble, but the pavement is half-empty, like the city's pulse is missing.

Walking along, you see the Eaton HK hotel across the street, its big billboard showing a series of arthouse Pride snapshots. No one spares it a glance. Then behind it, a love hotel, a discreet crescent moon logo above the entrance. You pass a roadside newsstand, with triad pulp comics, soft-core magazines sealed in black plastic, horse racing tip sheets. Hard to imagine it will last the year.

Katie's gaze lingers on the newsstand. "I've never actually seen anyone buy anything from these news vendors. Wonder how they make any money."

You say that you're seeing less and less of them around. Katie smiles and nods energetically in agreement. "Yeah! Feels like most of them just disappeared."

She steals a glance at the vendor, who's slouched in his flimsy fold-out chair, and looks at you. Lowers her voice. "Feels kind of sad, right? Like you look away for a while, and when you look back, part of the city's gone."

She runs her eyes slowly over the newsstand, and her smile fades. For the moment, there's no one else on this stretch of the pavement. She grabs your forearm lightly, palm not quite touching, and hesitantly pulls you along with her.

---

You continue along Nathan Road, a rapid-fire chime accompanying the green pedestrian light. A smell like damp cardboard wafts out of a cul-de-sac, as large warm droplets plop on the pavement, splashing onto your shoes, steady drips from air-conditioning units high above. You look up at the [i]tong lau[/i] with their protruding balconies, and sidestep the worst of the splatter zone.

Past another pedestrian crossing, you stroll past a plaster wall, empty but for the ghost of a pawn shop sign, the scar left behind where the lettering was removed. Just above head height, reflexology and foot massage billboards in simplified Chinese. On the street, sandwich boards in faded, coated plastic. Through a break in the phalanx of buildings above, you glimpse a bare metal frame, several storeys high, where the neon signs used to hang.

Ahead, clothes shops and property agencies and a burger joint. A vacant shopfront with an overflowing jumble of [i]For Rent[/i] signs, Centaline and Midland and more you don't recognise, enthusiastically pasted over each other, contoured like a three-dimensional map. You take a deep breath, the fresh air steadying you. A man approaches, hawking loudly, then sees you and redirects his spit to the gutter. 

A bright orange cylindrical rubbish bin stands near the railing, the shallow metal bowl on top full of cigarette butts, some still glowing amber. Black-and-white road signs announce Ning Po Street, Nanking Street. A sign advertises karaoke, backlit by an array of white fluorescents, the right half gone dark. Pink and blue neons beckon you into a "health centre", the blinking arrow pointing up a dark narrow staircase like bait. From a mahjong parlour comes the sharp crack of a tile slammed on wood.

An old woman blocks most of the sidewalk, an iron rod in her hand. She's stoking the flames in a metal barrel alongside offerings of poached chicken and barbecued pork in oily styrofoam boxes. The makeshift furnace blazes, spitting out ash and embers and choking black smoke that overpowers the minibus exhaust at the kerbside.

"Wow... is that a [i]paper house[/i]?"

Katie's eyes widen. "A stack of banknotes too. So many zeroes... wouldn't that, I don't know, mess up the economy on the other side?"

You see her eyes narrow slightly as she listens to her own words, then a slight frown. She looks at you, her head slightly tilted.

"That's fascinating to think about. If they have banknotes, that means they spend money in hell. But what would they buy?"

Katie beams and nods enthusiastically. "Clothes? Food? Air conditioners! Wait, no, this underworld isn't hot. It's different, right?"

"I saw [i]Journey to the West[/i] on TV a while ago. I think they have a lot of different things. Like one of them is that your bed is made of iron."

She bursts into delighted laughter. "That sounds terrible! You'd get a sore back when you woke up! Maybe your pillow is iron too!"

The old woman stops tending the fire and looks over, one eye narrowed in confusion. Katie mumbles a "sorry", still grinning, and gestures you towards the narrow gap between the concrete wall and the woman. As you squeeze past, Katie follows, close enough that you don't need to look back to feel her presence.

You're a block away from Jordan MTR now. The traffic is louder, but there's also the chatter of overlapping Cantonese and Mandarin conversations, music blaring from phone accessory shops. You pass a metal cart, a plastic cut-out window showing the [i]tong cung beng[/i] inside, honeycomb-like sugar cylinders dusted with coconut flakes and wrapped in a thin pancake. The vendor lifts the lid and chips at the honeycomb with a metal spatula. [i]Tink, tink, tink[/i]. A warm, nutty smell hits you. Don't see those much any more.

Overtaking you, a pair of shoppers wheeling Rimowas, the man sweating in chinos, dress shirt and blazer, the woman in a pink Juicy Couture tracksuit, oversized sunglasses to shield her from the dim light. She plants a quick, quiet peck on his cheek. He leans in, still looking forward, and they continue walking. The kiss is just a gesture. Something that keeps them going. Best not to dwell on it.

You can't tell if it was habit or intimacy. Either way, it was something fragile.

As you wait at the pedestrian light, you're bombarded by a cacophony of honking. A plug of taxis has blocked the intersection, and a truck driver is stabbing his finger at them and mouthing a stream of obscenities behind his rolled-up window. More cars and more taxis join in the honking, a medley of long, continuous screeches and rapid jabs of noise.

The light turns green, and you cross and approach the mouth of the MTR station. A pair of policemen straddle the entrance, clad in light blue shirts and dark blue cargo trousers. They scan the foot traffic, eyes sharp, hunting for anyone wearing the wrong clothes. No one looks up.

Katie gives the policemen a wide berth as you pass, but then turns to you. "I always wonder what their training is like. Do they get lessons on how to make everyone uncomfortable?"

"There's probably a whole course on it. Intro to staring people down."

Katie's cheeks dimple as she smiles, then she pulls you along by the wrist.

"Let's keep moving."

You pass a jewellery shop, its lone signpost still standing where the street used to shine. Your eyes sweep across the display window. Diamond specks framed in gold and platinum. A necklace, showcasing a fat pig in solid gold, with half a dozen dangling gold piglets. The pig's smiling.

A man in a grey T-shirt and shorts walks past you, pausing regularly to drill a Muay Thai block, knee rising, elbow dropping. You catch the salt and sweat as he passes. The crowd thickens at Austin Road, so you slip back onto Tak Shing Street, where the sidewalk breathes again. A 7-Eleven's there, next to an overly orange Mannings pharmacy. Two teens shuffle out, each holding malt Vitasoys and an opened bag of [i]Ethnicans[/i] potato chips, the smell of onion and garlic trailing behind them.

You nod at Katie and duck inside the 7-Eleven, the electronic door chime sharp and grating. You squeeze sideways between stacked shelves. You head for the hot food counter and order some takeaway [i]siu mai[/i]. He ladles a dozen of them into a flimsy plastic tray, pasty yellow skin wrapped around a lump of grey fish paste. He tosses a handful of thin bamboo skewers on top and hands it to you.

---

Carrying the food in one hand, you walk down Tak Shing street. It's just off the main road, but a few steps in and it's quiet. An unmanned currency booth on your left, the frozen exchange rates ghosted into the display. A Japanese restaurant, styrofoam box of dead mackerel left at the entrance. Property agencies, signs shouting HUGE DISCOUNT, EMIGRATION SALE. The prices are still seven figures.

At the end, a playground. Crumb rubber flooring, a slide barely a metre high, a swing with rust on the chains. No children. Around it, clusters of metal chairs, the steel a cold shock even in the summer heat. A few elderly residents are seated, reading newspapers, waving small hand fans, listening to stock tips on the radio.

You rest your arm on the armrest, then lift it away from the film of dried syrup. You shift slightly on the metal seat. Katie fidgets, then reaches for the tray. She skewers a [i]siu mai[/i] into her mouth without looking at it. A grimace, then she forces a swallow. "That's... not how it's supposed to taste."

Looking around, her eyes land on a row of metal chairs. "These chairs are warm, but your skin insists that it's cold. Nerves are so subjective."

"Cold or not, I just want to be next to you."

Her face reddens instantly, impossible to miss. She presses her palms against her cheeks, then drops them. You let the moment breathe. It's a while before she speaks again.

"That... makes me very happy. Thanks."

As her face slowly returns to its regular complexion, she looks down at your [i]siu mai[/i] tray.

Then, Katie sits up straight. She blurts out, "Do you... like me? Like not just for the research?"

She digs her fingers into her thighs as her legs bounce. "No, no! I didn't mean..."

Staring intently on the [i]siu mai[/i], she shoves one into her mouth. "These are... um, high in amino acids. Very functional," she mumbles through the mouthful.

"I like you."

Katie swallows hard, then faces you and starts to lean in. Then her brain catches up. Her eyes widen as she freezes, breath still, halfway to you.

She's completely stuck, so you gently lean in to meet her. Katie closes her eyes, a bit too hard.

A quick kiss on her lips.

Katie doesn't dare to look, trembling slightly as she holds the moment, a smile melting onto her face.

You ease her back, and she sinks into the seat with a contented sigh.

The swing creaks in the faint breeze.
