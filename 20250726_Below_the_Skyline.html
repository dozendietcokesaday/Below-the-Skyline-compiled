His lips part, then close.","","\"We're almost there,\" he says finally, as the bus turns onto a narrower, bumpier road flanked by overgrown greenery. \"Master Wong doesn't get many visitors these days.\"","","The minibus lurches to a halt on a small, quiet Yuen Long village road. You press two hefty five-dollar coins into the driver's leather-gloved hand as you step off. The air feels different \u2014 cleaner, cooler against your skin, scented with woodsmoke and damp earth, a stark change from the city's acrid diesel fumes. Old stone houses with faded tile roofs line narrow, paved streets where chickens peck nonchalantly near open doorways, their soft clucking and the occasional flap of wings punctuating the quiet atmosphere. A few elderly villagers converse quietly in shaded spots, their voices a low whisper.","","Eric leads the way without speaking, turning onto a dirt trail that winds upwards between dense bamboo groves. Your footsteps crunch on fallen leaves and loose pebbles. The air grows cooler in the shade, carrying the distinctive fragrance of wild lemongrass and camphor.","","After about fifteen minutes of steady hiking, the trail widens into a clearing. There stands a modest Hakka dwelling with blue-grey brick walls and red clay roof tiles, small metal-barred windows, and a squat stone chimney. Surrounding it is a small, neatly tended garden of vegetables and herbs.","","\"This is it,\" Eric says, his voice softer than usual.

He carries himself easily, each step precise yet fluid, his compact frame exuding quiet strength that seems to disturb the air around him. His eyes, sharp and piercing. They settle on you immediately, their gaze cool against your skin.","","\"Eric,\" the old man says, his voice quietly resonant. \"You're late.\"","","\"The minibus driver waited for all the seats to fill before leaving,\" Eric responds, bowing his head slightly in a gesture of respect. \"Master Wong, this is ${first_name} ${last_name}, the training partner I mentioned.\"","","After a silence that stretches for several long seconds, Master Wong nods and turns back towards the house. \"Come inside. The tea is getting cold.\"","","*page_break","The main room appears spartan but immaculate. It carries the faint scents of aged cedarwood, dried chrysanthemum, and oolong tea. Training staffs lean neatly against one wall beneath yellowed scrolls of elegant Chinese calligraphy. Opposite them, several gleaming, well-maintained blades hang in simple racks, their polished steel surfaces reflecting the amber window light. Your socked feet whisper across hardwood floors burnished to a soft glow.","","Master Wong gestures wordlessly for you both to sit at a low wooden table where three steaming cups of pale green tea are already waiting, their delicate, grassy aroma filling the quiet space.","","\"So this is your new student,\" Master Wong says, his gaze settling on Eric after you are all seated on floor cushions.","","\"Training partner,\" Eric corrects gently. \"We've been working together for about a month now.\"","","Master Wong makes a noncommittal sound as he lifts his cup, his eyes still observing you over the rim. The silence stretches again, punctuated only by quiet sips of tea. You shift slightly on the cushion, suddenly aware of the dust motes dancing in the shaft of light from the window.

When you finish, he nods slowly, remarking, \"At least you do not lie to yourself. That is a beginning.\"","","He turns his attention back to Eric. \"And you? Have you found answers to your questions?\"","","\"I'm working on balancing the traditional training with the energy techniques, like you suggested, Master. Focusing on precision and control rather than just raw power.\"","","\"Hmm.\" Master Wong sets down his tea cup with a soft tap. \"Show me.\"","","Eric rises immediately, moving smoothly to an open area of the floor. He begins a sequence of movements, flowing from one stance to another. Energy gathers as soft, cohesive flows of amber light that trace the path of his limbs.","","Master Wong watches Eric's form and the energy flow. When Eric finishes, returning to a ready stance, the old master remains silent for several seconds.","","\"Better,\" he finally pronounces. \"You no longer fight your own power or try to suppress it. But you still think of it as something separate from yourself, something to be controlled rather than expressed.\"","","Eric's forehead creases. \"I thought control was the goal.\"","","\"Control implies struggle,\" Master Wong replies gently. \"When you struggle against yourself, how can you reach your fullest capability?\" He rises from the table with a fluid grace that belies his age. \"Come. Both of you.\"","","He leads you outside to a small, packed-earth clearing behind the house where three weathered wooden posts stand embedded in the ground in a rough triangle formation. Master Wong positions himself in the centre.","","\"Watch,\" he instructs simply.","","*page_break","What ensues is unlike any martial arts display you've seen before. Master Wong begins to move.

The air around him thickens, carrying a faint metallic taste that tingles on your tongue. As he moves, the space between him and the posts seems to compress, waves of heat distorting your vision slightly.","","After less than a minute, Master Wong returns to a neutral stance, the gentle energy dissipating gradually, like ripples fading on calm water.","","\"The energy is not a weapon to be fired,\" he says quietly. \"It is an extension of yourself, as natural as your breath, as inherent as your balance.\"","","Eric exhales through his nose, fists briefly clenched. \"In tournaments...\" he starts, then shakes his head. \"It's not about balance out there. It's about power. Spectacle.\"","","\"Ah, tournaments,\" Master Wong sighs. \"Glory. Spectacle. You learn these skills for what purpose, Eric? To impress crowds? To win trophies?\"","","\"To test myself,\" Eric responds, his chin lifting slightly. \"To measure my progress against others.\"","","\"And how do you measure your progress?\" Master Wong says, his gaze intense. \"Can judges score it?\"","","Silence settles into the space between them.

Your exhale mingles with the air around you; warmth radiates beyond your fingertips. You sense a subtle field extending inches from your body, pulsing with your heartbeat but also responding to the energies nearby.","","        \"Now you begin to understand,\" Master Wong says, satisfaction evident in his voice. \"This is the foundation of all that we do.\"","","As the afternoon light begins to slant through the bamboo, Master Wong calls an end to the session. Inside again, over a simple meal of fragrant white rice, crisp steamed Chinese broccoli, and tangy pickled mustard greens, the conversation inevitably shifts back to Eric's upcoming competitions. Wooden chopsticks click gently against the bowls, the sound mingling with the occasional hiss of the dented iron kettle warming on a small burner in the corner.","","\"These commercial events,\" Master Wong says, shaking his head slowly as he picks up a piece of broccoli with his chopsticks. \"They encourage the wrong things. Flash over substance. Power over harmony. Spectacle over skill.\"","","\"They also pay the bills, Master,\" Eric counters respectfully. \"And they give me a platform. A chance to demonstrate what real skill can look like.\"","","\"And when will you demonstrate that?\" Master Wong asks, setting down his chopsticks. \"Power with purpose? Responsibility?\"","","Silence reigns, broken only by the soft clink of chopsticks. You focus intently on the grains of rice in your own bowl, suddenly feeling like an intruder privy to a long-standing family disagreement.","","Master Wong sighs, a long, slow exhalation, and his stern expression softens almost imperceptibly. \"You have progressed, Eric, that much is clear. Your control is better, your understanding deeper.

But you now have a way to practise what he taught \u2014 quietly, alone.[/i]","*set eric_friendship +2","*return","","*label event_4","The vast secondary training hall at the Hong Kong Sports Institute echoes with the sharp snap of Eric's gi and his focused, controlled breathing, sounds magnified in the otherwise silent space. The Pearl River Cup looms. Etched onto his face is the evidence of his intense preparation \u2014 dark circles smudged beneath his eyes, faint yellowing bruises mottling his forearms. The air conditioning hums overhead, carrying a faint scent of floor polish.","","Eric had invited you to this private after-hours session. The cavernous hall, usually bustling, stands empty except for the two of you, the rows of unused equipment standing like silent witnesses under the bright fluorescent lights.","","\"Right,\" Eric says, sweat already darkening the back of his gi despite the hall's cool, air-conditioned temperature. He tosses you a pair of reinforced focus mitts that feel dense and surprisingly heavy in your hands. \"I need to work on the transition. Physical to energy, making it seamless.\"","","For the next thirty minutes, you hold the mitts as he works through increasingly complex striking sequences. A faint amber glow begins to emerge, trailing each punch, flickering along his arms in rhythm with the motion. It's not fully stable. Not yet. But it's starting to weave in, settling as an undercurrent.","","He moves through another sequence, tighter this time, more fluid. Three strikes land clean. But on the last one, the glow flares sharp and late \u2014 a spike of heat that throws off his balance. He exhales sharply, adjusting his stance.","","\"Still too much at the end,\" he mutters. \"Needs to flow the whole way through.\"","","He wipes his face with the towel, breath still quick. The mats beneath him are already slick with sweat.","","*fake_choice","    #Compliment his progress with the energy integration.","        *gosub_scene utils increase_empathy","        \"You're getting better at blending your energy with your physical movements,\" you say. \"It looks more natural now, less forced.\"","        ","        Eric nods, a flicker of satisfaction crossing his face. \"That's exactly what I'm working on. Master Wong keeps saying the energy should feel like an extension, not an addition.\"","    #Share an insight connecting his training to Master Wong's teachings.","        *gosub_scene utils increase_analysis","        *set eric_friendship +1","        \"This reminds me of what Master Wong showed us,\" you observe. \"The energy flowing naturally rather than being forced.

I've been so focused on making the technique work that I almost missed the actual lesson.\"","    #Focus on the practical applications for the upcoming tournament.","        *gosub_scene utils increase_composure","        \"This approach should give you more endurance in the later rounds,\" you observe. \"Less energy wasted on flashy bursts.\"","","        \"Exactly,\" Eric agrees, rolling his shoulders. \"The Pearl River Cup goes five rounds minimum. Can't afford to burn out early like last year.\"","","Eric nods slowly, absorbing your words. A pause. \"There's still one technique I need to refine for the Pearl River Cup.\" His jaw tightens almost imperceptibly. \"The [i]Volcanic Dragon Ascent[/i].\"","","He instructs you to circle him, throwing occasional light, probing attacks. After tracking your movements for a minute, letting his senses attune, he meets your eye and flicks his chin towards the edge. You back away.","","He launches into a rising uppercut where raw, volatile energy explodes around his striking arm, throwing off waves of heat and filling the air with sharp ozone. It coalesces into a roaring, dragon-shaped flame that engulfs his upper body. But midway through the final strike, a jagged flicker sparks across his knuckles \u2014 unstable, too long.","","He lands hard, off-balance. Breath ragged. Shakes out his wrist.","","\"Damn it,\" he mutters. \"Still unstable. Still wrong.\"","    ","He sits down briefly, rubbing at his wrist. \"Sometimes I wonder what life would've been like if I'd never figured out the energy thing.\"","","\"When did Master Wong figure out his powers anyway?\" you ask.","","\"He says it happened during a dance break. Back when he was in a boy band. Claims he accidentally zapped a backup dancer.\"","","He takes an easy breath and adjusts the wrist wrap on his right hand.","","For the next hour, Eric repeats the demanding technique relentlessly \u2014 dozens of times. Around the twentieth repetition, the veins in his forearms begin to protrude. Sweat pours down his face, dripping onto the polished floor with audible [i]taps[/i] in the quiet hall, while his breathing turns ragged, each inhale sounding harsh and strained, punctuated by sharp exhales at the peak of each attempt. A faint pallor emerges on his skin. His hands tremble slightly.","","After the thirtieth attempt, the pauses between repetitions stretch longer. He leans forward, hands on his knees, head down.","","*choice","    #Suggest he take a break and analyse what's happening.","        *gosub_scene utils increase_analysis","        *set eric_friendship +1","        \"Let's pause for a minute,\" you suggest. \"Sometimes you can see more clearly when you step back.\"","","        Eric hesitates, then nods reluctantly. \"Maybe you're right.\" He straightens slowly, wincing. \"I keep feeling like I'm missing something fundamental in the energy flow. Just one last try and then we'll take a break.\"","    #Offer encouragement to push through.","        *gosub_scene utils increase_composure","        \"You're almost there,\" you say. \"I can see the pattern improving with each attempt.\"","","        Eric gives you a grateful nod and takes a deep breath. \"One more time, then.\" He sets his jaw, determination overriding the fatigue evident in his posture.","    #Ask why the move keeps breaking down.","        *gosub_scene utils increase_analysis","        \"What exactly makes this technique so difficult?\" you ask. \"The energy consumption or the execution?\"","","        \"Both,\" Eric says, straightening up with visible effort. \"The dragon requires precise energy control and the uppercuts need precise physical control. Let's try this one more time.\"","","He launches into it again. This time, as he completes the final strike, the fiery energy doesn't fade cleanly. It clings to his arm like thick, burning honey, pulsing erratically with a low, angry [i]sizzle[/i] and a faint smell of ozone and something vaguely burnt. Eric lands unsteadily. He staggers sideways, his right arm hanging limp at his side. Then his legs give out and he drops heavily to one knee, gasping for air, a tremor running through his entire body.","","You rush forward instinctively. He waves you off weakly with his left hand. \"I'm... fine,\" he manages between breaths. \"Just... pushed it too far.\" His complexion now has a distinct grey-green tinge under the harsh lights, and both his hands are shaking visibly.","","\"What happened?\" you ask, offering him his water bottle.","","\"Energy burnout,\" he explains, gulping down water between ragged breaths. \"The pathways... get overloaded. Like sugar charring if you look away for a second.\"","","He sits heavily on a nearby bench, letting the bottle rest in his lap. \"Master Wong warned me about this,\" he admits, his voice low. \"He says forcing these high-output energy techniques without proper harmonisation... it's like trying to direct a river through a garden hose. Eventually, something gives.\"","","*choice","    #Ask about other fighters who use similar techniques.","        *gosub_scene utils increase_analysis","        \"Do other fighters at the Pearl River Cup use techniques like this?\" you ask. \"Or is this something unique to your style?\"","","        \"A few others have energy projection abilities,\" Eric explains, wincing as he rotates his shoulder. \"But most use simple bursts or enhancements. This level of manipulation is rare. That's why I need to perfect it.\"","","        He looks down at his trembling right hand. \"The Pearl River Cup is too important. The Volcanic Dragon Ascent... it's my signature move.\" He swallows hard before meeting your eyes. \"It's the one thing that separates me from the other fighters.\"","    #Suggest a modified version that requires less energy.","        *gosub_scene utils increase_composure","        \"What if you developed a less intense version?\" you suggest. \"Something that achieves similar results without the burnout risk.\"","","        Eric frowns slightly. \"A watered-down version won't have the same impact. The judges and audience expect something spectacular.\"","","        He pauses, gaze drifting to the floor. \"But you might have a point about sustainability.\" He says the word like it doesn't belong here \u2014 like it's something you plan for after a loss, not before a fight.","","        Then he looks up, jaw tight. \"The Pearl River Cup is too important. The Volcanic Dragon Ascent... it's my signature move.\" The words come fast, like he needs them to be true. \"It's the one thing that separates me from the other fighters.\"","    #Express concern and suggest a more balanced approach.","        *gosub_scene utils increase_empathy","        *set eric_friendship +1","        \"Your body is telling you something important,\" you say quietly. \"What if instead of forcing the technique, you try harmonising it with your natural movement? Like that energy flow we practised earlier.\"","","        Eric looks up, considering your words. His expression shifts from frustration to thoughtful recognition. \"That... actually makes sense. Master Wong always said energy should follow intention, not force.\" He flexes his hand experimentally. \"Maybe I've been approaching this all wrong.\"","","        But even as he says it, doubt creeps in. His gaze returns to his trembling right hand and shakes his head stubbornly. \"But the Pearl River Cup is too important. The Volcanic Dragon Ascent... it's my signature move.\" He looks up at you, a flicker of desperation in his eyes. \"It's the one thing that separates me from the other fighters.\"","","\"Is that separation worth hurting yourself over?\"","","\"You sound like Master Wong, ${first_name},\" Eric mutters, flexing his hand. His tone stays flat, but his eyes flick away. \"Harmony over power \u2014 that's his whole thing.\" He rubs his arm, slower now. \"But he's never fought in front of cameras. Never had to make it look like a show.\"","","\"I've seen you fight both ways,\" you point out quietly. \"You won that traditional tournament without using any energy abilities at all.\"","","\"That was different. Local competition, lower stakes,\" Eric counters. \"The Pearl River Cup... it has international fighters, media coverage, scouts watching every move. It's a different world.\"","","Reaching into his bag, he pulls out the small container of Master Wong's herbal salve. Opening it releases a sharp, medicinal scent \u2014 camphor, mint, and something earthy. He starts to massage the pungent green ointment into his arm with slow, careful movements, the coolness of the salve contrasting with the lingering heat of the energy burnout. The tremors in his hand diminish as the salve takes effect.","","*page_break","\"One more attempt,\" Eric says, pushing himself to his feet, his movements still stiff. He takes a breath, steadies his stance. \"But different. A modified version... less raw power, more integration. Focusing on the flow, the way Master Wong would approach it.\"","","This time, his preparation appears more measured, his breathing slower. He gathers himself inwardly before beginning. The energy emerges differently too \u2014 not as an explosion, but as a subtle golden glow that gradually intensifies, weaving around his arm. The dragon manifests as a luminous extension of his movements. Each strike flows naturally into the next.","","When Eric lands this time, his balance is perfect, his breathing controlled. The golden energy disperses softly, quietly. A pleasant warmth lingers in the space, along with the faint scent of fresh earth after rain. He turns to you, his eyebrows raised slightly in surprise at his own success.","","\"That... felt different,\" he says, examining his now steady hand with a thoughtful expression. \"Less raw output, maybe, but... smoother. More effective, somehow.\"","","*fake_choice","    #Acknowledge how the technique seemed more powerful despite using less raw energy.","        *gosub_scene utils increase_analysis","        \"That wasn't just more controlled \u2014 it looked more powerful,\" you observe. \"Like the energy was working with your movements instead of being forced through them.\"","","        Eric considers this, hand on his chin. \"You might be right.

This could change everything.\"","","\"It looked more controlled,\" you confirm. \"More precise. More like what Master Wong demonstrated back at his place.\"","","Eric nods slowly, a contemplative look on his face. \"Maybe the old man has a point after all.\" He begins gathering his scattered equipment. \"Right. I think that's enough for today.\"","","As you are packing your own bag, about to leave the silent hall, Eric turns to you. His eyes meet yours briefly before falling away to the floor. \"Hey... would you be interested in coming to the Pearl River Cup? Not just as a spectator... but in my corner.\"","","A hesitation. \"I could use someone there who... understands what I'm trying to work towards. The balance.\"","","*fake_choice","    #\"You don't have to ask twice.\"","        *set eric_friendship +1","        You consider the unexpected offer for a moment, then nod. \"Yeah.

The hum of the air conditioning fades. Eric glances back at the empty hall.","","\"Thanks,\" he says quietly. \"For pushing back when I needed it.\"","","You both step outside into the cool evening air. At the bus stop, Eric offers a small, thoughtful nod before turning towards home.","","[i]A new Boxing Insight settles. Not explosive, but quietly anchored. Energy no longer flaring, just flowing.[/i]","*return","","*label event_5","Heavy and damp, the early morning mist clings to the mountainside as your taxi cautiously navigates the steep, winding road up toward the peak of Tai Mo Shan. When you arrive at the designated trailhead, Eric is already waiting, leaning against a weathered wooden sign. Dressed in practical hiking clothes rather than his usual training gear, a simple backpack slung over one shoulder, his eyes meet yours briefly\u2014a flicker of something unreadable in their depths\u2014before flicking away again. His jaw looks tight, his shoulders held stiffly.","","\"Thanks for coming,\" he says, his voice quiet, almost subdued. \"There's a place up here... a place I want to show you.\"","","You begin ascending the narrow, rocky trail together, the crunch of your boots on loose scree and your synchronized breathing the only sounds breaking the misty quiet. Neither of you mentions the Pearl River Cup, the unspoken subject hanging heavy in the cool, damp air between you. A faint purple-yellow bruise peeks out from beneath the collar of Eric's jacket, and you notice his right hand occasionally flexes and unflexes, as if working through some lingering stiffness or ache. He sets a brisk, steady pace, pushing upward, the trail narrowing as the sprawling panorama of Hong Kong gradually disappears beneath a sea of clouds below.","","\"I used to come up here to train sometimes... with Master Wong,\" Eric finally says, breaking the silence as you pause for water near a small waterfall tumbling over moss-covered rocks, its fine spray cool against your face. \"He said the mountain air... clarified the mind. Helped with focus.\"","","Halfway up, Eric stops abruptly at a switchback where the trail doubles back on itself. His breathing has grown ragged\u2014not from exertion, but something else. He braces one hand against the rock face, fingers splayed wide.","","\"I shouldn't have brought you here,\" he says suddenly, not looking at you. \"This was a mistake.\"","","*choice","    #\"We can go back if you need to.\"","        *gosub_scene utils increase_empathy","        *set eric_friendship +1","        \"We can go back if you need to,\" you offer quietly. \"No judgment.\"","","        Eric's hand tightens against the rock. For a moment, you think he might take the out. Then he pushes off from the wall, jaw set.","","        \"No. I've been running from this conversation for weeks.\" He resumes climbing, but his pace is less punishing now. \"Master Wong says I compartmentalize too much. Keep things separate that should be connected.\"","","    #\"What are you afraid I'll see?\"","        *gosub_scene utils increase_analysis","        *set eric_friendship +1","        \"What are you afraid I'll see?\" you ask directly.","","        Eric flinches slightly, then lets out a short, bitter laugh. \"That's the problem. I don't know.\" He resumes climbing, but slower now. \"Maybe that I'm not who I've been pretending to be. Maybe that Master Wong was right all along.\"","","        \"About what?\"","","        \"About everything,\" he mutters, pushing forward up the trail.","","    #Say nothing and wait.","        *gosub_scene utils increase_composure","        You don't push. Just adjust your pack and wait, giving him space to work through whatever's churning inside.","","        After a long moment, Eric's shoulders drop slightly. \"Sorry. I'm being...\" He trails off, then starts walking again. \"Let's just get to the top.\"","","        The tension doesn't leave his frame, but he stops trying to outrun it.","","After another thirty minutes of steady climbing, the trail levels out onto a small, grassy plateau where a steady wind sighs through the sparse grass, carrying the scent of damp earth and high-altitude vegetation. Here grows a single, ancient-looking tree, its trunk twisted at an impossible angle against the wind. Beyond it, the mountainside drops away sharply, offering a breathtaking, cloud-interrupted view of the New Territories stretching out below.","","\"This is the spot,\" Eric says quietly, his fingers trailing over the rough, weathered bark of the old tree with an unexpected tenderness. \"Right here. This is where it happened. Where I first... discovered I could project energy. Seven years ago.\"","","He moves away from the tree and sits down near the edge of the plateau, legs dangling over the drop. \"I was seventeen,\" he continues, his voice low, introspective. \"Obsessed with winning tournaments, proving myself.\" The corner of his mouth pulls back in what might be a wince of remembered embarrassment. \"I lost a match I should have won. Came up here afterward, furious. I threw a punch, just hitting the air in frustration... and suddenly there was this... energy. Pouring from my hand like uncontrolled electricity, hot and terrifying, making the air crackle. Scared the hell out of me.\"","","He holds up his right hand, studying it. \"Set the grass on fire. Could have burned down half the mountain if it hadn't started raining.\" A pause. \"Master Wong found me the next day. Said he'd felt the energy disruption all the way down in the village.\"","","*page_break","Eric stands up abruptly, moving to the very edge of the plateau, staring out into the swirling mist. \"He taught me to control it, eventually. But we always disagreed about what these abilities were for. I saw opportunity, recognition, a way to stand out. He saw... purpose. Responsibility.\" His shoulders hunch slightly under the weight of the memory. ","","Turning back to you, he asks, \"Did you know there are others? Like me? People with... gifts. Abilities that go beyond normal human capability.\"","","\"I've started to suspect as much,\" you reply, thinking of the impossible things you've witnessed in the underground circuit, the fighters whose styles defy conventional explanation.","","\"The Pearl River Cup... it changed something for me,\" Eric continues, leading you a few steps away from the edge, toward a small patch of bare earth near the tree's roots. \"Final round. I had the perfect opening for the Dragon Ascent, the crowd was roaring... but Master Wong's voice was suddenly right there in my head: 'Power without purpose becomes merely spectacle.' Clear as day.\" He shakes his head again. \"I hesitated. Just for a second. Long enough to lose the opening, lose the match.\"","","He glances sideways at you, then back towards the mist.","","\"You were there. You saw it. The whole crowd wanted fire, and I gave them nothing.\"","","His fists clench. \"And the worst part? Part of me was relieved. Relieved I didn't have to make the choice.\"","","He kneels down at the edge of the bare patch, placing both palms flat on the cool, damp soil. \"Afterward... after the tournament... I came back up here. Tried to figure things out. And I discovered something. Or it discovered me. I'm still not sure which.\"","","A soft, golden glow emanates from his hands, spreading gently into the earth beneath them. Unlike the crackling, intense energy of his combat techniques, this feels different. Gentler, warmer, more diffuse\u2014you can feel a subtle warmth radiating from his palms even from a few feet away. ","","For a moment, nothing happens. Then tiny green shoots begin to emerge from the dark, damp soil where his hands rest. They grow visibly, unfurling delicate leaves\u2014","","Then they wither. Blacken. Crumble to ash.","","Eric jerks his hands back as if burned. \"Damn it!\" The frustration in his voice is raw. \"Every time.

The air conditioner hums steadily overhead, circulating recycled air that's neither cool nor warm. Katie's already in the space \u2014 a function room in the podium clubhouse of a private housing estate \u2014 kneeling by a row of tape measures on the carpet. Sensor cables snake out from her duffel bag. She works quickly, arranging the tape measures in geometrical patterns. Doesn't look up when you enter.","","When she does, the smile arrives too fast, like she had rehearsed it in front of a mirror.","","\"You came, ${first_name}! That's cool. I wasn't sure if I confirmed the time properly. I always forget that step. Anyway, you're here!\"","","She bombards you with a breathless explanation \u2014 how she's not a resident here, but their website uses an old reservation portal, so she logged in as admin, she doesn't remember how, clicked the wrong thing and got in, now it technically isn't listed, which means no one should be here, and then she talked to the maintenance guy about muscle fatigue recovery until he surrendered the door key.","","It keeps going.

The device gleams through the wrapping, like an aggressively hostile TV remote control, all angles and protrusions.","","\"So the compression joints adapt to your nerve signals,\" she begins, words tumbling over each other in her excitement. \"The micro-dampeners automatically adjust to how your muscles normally behave, and the torque system filters out random movements so we only measure real responses.\"","","Her hands gesture animatedly as she continues. Circuitry specifications, material composition, electrical pathways. The technical terms flow uninterrupted, and she's three sentences into electrode sensitivity thresholds before she notices your expression.","","\"Oh.\" Her monologue skids to a halt. \"I was being too technical again. I do that.\" Her shoulders drop slightly. \"I just assume people...\" The sentence dies as she evaporates it with a flutter of her fingers. \"Never mind.\"","","Only afterwards do you realise the sentence wasn't meant for you. It was reflex. Deployed, then withdrawn, like muscle memory.","","She peels the backing off a sensor patch, the adhesive producing a reluctant tearing sound.

Katie's hand is still wrapped around the sensor patch, her eyes trying to read your non-reaction. The quiet stretches just long enough for the hum of the air conditioner to become noticeable again. You let the moment rest without rushing to fill it, allowing her to find her footing without the pressure of an immediate response.","","Katie starts explaining again, but this time she watches your face between sentences. Like she's adjusting in real time, not just replaying a stored script.","","Three exercises with the wooden rods from last time, each one targeting different nerve groups. Gentle pressure to familiarise the nerves with discomfort without triggering a panic response. Then reinforcement and conditioning. She explains the exercises are based on judo principles. \"Not published. Yet.\" The pride in her voice is unmistakable.","","Each time you complete an exercise set, she scans the sensors and makes small adjustments to how you hold the wooden dowels, her eyes moving between your reactions and the digital readout on her tablet.","","*choice","    #You watch how she tracks the feedback and modifies the pressure points in real time.","        *gosub_scene utils increase_analysis","        You track her process like it's a system to decode.

Her movements are efficient, her decision-making rapid and confident.","    #You notice how she studies your face after each tweak, looking for signs of discomfort.","        *gosub_scene utils increase_empathy","        Her gaze lingers after each tweak, scanning for discomfort \u2014 the tightening around your eyes, a small clench in your jaw when you swallow, cheeks tensing slightly. It's not purely data collection. There's a gentleness in how she eases pressure even before you react.","","        It's strange. She seems so disconnected from others usually, but now she's hyper-aware of your smallest reactions. \"This one might sting,\" she says, but her voice is soft. You realise she's mirroring your careful attention.","    #You hold still through the exercises, steady enough for her to calibrate by feel.","        *gosub_scene utils increase_composure","        You stay perfectly still, your breathing steady, even when the pressure hits your nerve clusters.

You've learned to control your response in a really short time.\"","","        \"Makes the readings much cleaner, too.\" The air conditioner cycles off, leaving the room in silence broken only by the soft tap of her fingertips on the tablet screen.","","Katie retrieves what looks like a tuning fork from her duffel bag. It's wrapped in layers of electrical tape, and a small plastic handle adorns the base. A copper wire extends from the stem, leading to a battery pack.","","\"This prototype is different from the other tools. It doesn't suppress pain, it modulates it. No one has ever made something like this before.\"","","She flicks a tiny switch. You feel a vibration like standing too close to a subwoofer. It's not sound, but your skin registers the pulse, and your muscles flinch like they're bracing for impact.","","\"This delivers targeted micro-vibrations at specific frequencies. That can scramble or dampen nerve signals, rather like jamming a radio channel,\" she continues, staring with barely contained excitement at the prongs. \"The fork's not electrical. That's what makes it safer. It's closer to a haptic illusion. Like what they use in neural rehab for phantom limb pain, just tuned more aggressively. If the brain gets a corrupted signal from a nerve, it either downplays it or reroutes it. This fork introduces just enough distortion to confuse the interpretation.\"","","Katie kneels beside you, bringing the device closer to your forearm. Her knuckles are white against the plastic handle. \"I ran calibration last night,\" she says too quickly. \"So it should be fine.\" Her eyes don't leave your arm. Her movements are precise and deliberate, but her fingers hover for a few moments above your skin. She takes a breath to steady herself.","","She touches the fork to your forearm.","","*page_break","There's no pain. Not yet.","","Just a hum that vibrates in your bones. Not sound.

Somewhere nearby, water glugs through old pipes, slow and indifferent.","","\"Thanks for showing up today,\" she says, not looking at you as she crams the gear into her duffel bag. The zip catches halfway and stays there.","","Your forearm still hums from the fork. Not pain, just a lingering echo, like your nerves haven't agreed on what version of events to report.

/* The function needs some explaining.
We want the game to be "refreshable," e.g. on the web.
So we only make a "real" autosave as you click "Next"
But if we do it that way, when we visit the stat screen, it's out of date
So we make a "temp" autosave slot, right as the page finishes redrawing,
and the stat screen uses the "temp" autosave to display your current data.
When you refresh the page, the "temp" autosave is rewritten.

If you save stats on the stat screen, they're written into tempStatWrites;
when the stat screen saves, we transfer tempStatWrites back to the main
game (if the main game is running in a separate iframe, e.g. iOS).

If the main game is about to write the main "" slot, we merge the temp
stat writes into the main stats (and clear the stat writes) before
saving.

Thus, stat changes on the stat screen will only be permanently saved when
the player clicks "Next" in the main game, ensuring that the game is still
refreshable.
